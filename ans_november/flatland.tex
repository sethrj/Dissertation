\section{Introduction}
Flatland geometry is a fictional two-dimensional space where particles are
constrained to the page \cite{Asa2008}. This differs from standard 2-D
geometry, which is the projection of a 3-D problem onto the page. The
constraint of living in the page reduces the phase space of the transport
equation, as the flatland solution is only a function of the azimuthal angle
rather than both azimuthal and polar angles. This reduction in phase space
makes flatland geometry a computationally less burdensome testing ground for new
methods \cite{Lar2009a}.

Previous work in flatland has shown that the diffusion
coefficient for flatland geometry $\frac{1}{2\sigma}$ is different from
the physical diffusion coefficients $\frac{1}{3\sigma}$, but the correct
formulation for flatland diffusion boundary conditions have remained an
unanswered and indeed unasked question. This summary derives both a Marshak
boundary condition and a variational boundary condition.
