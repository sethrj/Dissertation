A Hybrid Anisotropic Diffusion Approximation to Radiation Transport

The subject of my dissertation is a new method that resembles the diffusion 
approximation but is applicable to problems with voided regions, with 
particular application to time-dependent thermal radiative transfer. Under 
certain conditions, this anisotropic diffusion (AD) method provides much more 
accurate solutions than diffusion for only a little extra computational cost.

Using the integral transport equation for the angular flux, we derive an
expression for the current that depends on a non-local function of the
total cross section. This nonlocal function is the solution of a purely 
absorbing transport equation, and the function's second angular moment is the 
anisotropic diffusion tensor. A system of low-order equations solves for the 
scalar flux using the AD coefficients. To demonstrate the AD method's speed and 
efficacy, we simulate a radiation shock in a partially voided tube.
