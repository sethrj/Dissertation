\begin{frame}{What is flatland?}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Fictional two-dimensional universe \cite{Abb1884} in which particles
      are constrained to exist and travel in a 2-D plane
    \item Multi-dimensional geometry with smaller phase space in angle
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Flatland: $(x,y,\omega)$; 2-D: $(x,y,\mu,\omega)$
        \item Polar cosine is set to zero
      \end{itemize}
    \item Useful testbed for methods development
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Smaller phase space means computationally cheaper
        \item Angle-dependent quantities are easier to visualize
      \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
