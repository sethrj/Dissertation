\section{Introduction}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Design goals}
\begin{block}{Primary mission}
   To graduate in a timely manner.
\end{block}


\begin{itemize}
  \item rapid, error-free implementation of new methods,
  \item easy definition of multiple-method test problems,
  \item high-performance solver kernels to run the problems quickly,
  \item powerful data analysis tools driven by user needs (me), and
  \item automated generation of high-quality figures.
\end{itemize}
  
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Capabilities}
Cartesian product of methods:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Steady-state, linear time-dependent, and nonlinear (semi-implicit)
    TRT
  \item 1-D, Flatland, 2-D
  \item Monte Carlo, \SN\ transport, diffusion, \Pone, anisotropic diffusion
\end{itemize}

Analysis:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Lineout
  \item Angleout
  \item Matrixout
  \item Silo for VisIT
\end{itemize}
  
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Techniques}
Reliability:
\begin{itemize}
  \item CMake build process
  \item Git for version control
  \item Unit tests (regression)
  \item Design By Contract
  \item Modular design
  \item Trilinos for linear algebra\footnote{Two-edged sword in terms of
    reliability}
\end{itemize}

Code reuse:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Template on geometry, etc.
  \item Python wrapper handles linearization
  \item Python handles all the stuff that only needs to happen once
\end{itemize}
  
\end{frame}

\section{Object-oriented boundary conditions}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]{Object oriented boundary conditions}
  \begin{itemize}
\item Abstract \verb|BoundaryCondition| class:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item At least one \verb|apply| method
    \item Other methods like \verb|getIncidentSourceRate|
  \end{itemize}

\item Generic \verb|BcManager| class:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item The problem definition contains a \verb|BcManager| object
    \item Vector that maps \verb|BoundaryFace| to \verb|BoundaryCondition*|
    \item Functors to help with modifying multiple boundary conditions
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]{Diffusion/constructed matrix}
  \begin{verbatim}
void MyBc::apply(const BoundaryFaceT& bface,
                 ProxyVector& vec) const
{
    const CellT& cell = *insideBoundaryCell(&bface);
    source.getFlux()[ cell ] += /* some value */;
}

void apply(const BoundaryFaceT& bface,
           Operator& matrix) const
{
    const CellT& cell = *insideBoundaryCell(&bface);
    matrix.startRow( matrix.getFlux()[cell] );
    matrix.pushRowElement( matrix.getFlux()[cell], /*val*/);
    matrix.finishRow();
}
  \end{verbatim}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Diffusion/constructed matrix}
Called after initializing source vector:
\begin{verbatim}
	bcs.apply( <Traits::BcManagerT, ProxyVector>(sourceVec) );
\end{verbatim}
  
Called after the internal part of the diffusion matrix has been built:
\begin{verbatim}
  startMatrix( ACCUMULATE );
  bcs.apply(BcOperatorApplier<Traits>(*this));
  finishMatrix();
\end{verbatim}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]{\SN\ boundary conditions}
  \begin{verbatim}
void ReflectingBoundaryCondition::apply(
        const BoundaryFaceT& bface,
        Vector& source ) const
{
    bool onNegBoundary = bface.getFace()->onNegBoundary();
    unsigned int axis = bface.getFace()->getAxis();
    FluxDiscreteT& sourceFlux = source.getBoundaryFlux()[ bface ];
    for (QuadratureSetT::const_iterator angle = qs_.begin();
            angle != qs_.end(); ++angle)
    {
        if (isPositive(angle->getOmega()[axis]) == onNegBoundary ) {
            sourceFlux[ *angle ]
                = sourceFlux[ qs_.getReflectedAngle(*angle, axis) ];
        }
    }
}
  \end{verbatim}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]{MC boundary conditions}
  \begin{verbatim}
template<class ProblemTraits_T>
void VacuumBoundaryCondition<ProblemTraits_T>::apply(
        const BoundaryFaceT& bface,
        ParticleT& particle,
        Tally& tally) const
{
    tally.particleExited( bface, particle );
    particle.markDestroyed();
}
  \end{verbatim}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Python}
\begin{frame}[fragile]{Python structure}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \verb|Manager| class emits \cpp\ problem depending on module passed
      to it (duck typing)
    \item \verb|Solver| handles time stepping, callbacks, user feedback, etc.
    \item Callbacks include Silo output, liveplot, lineout, angleout, MC
      particle tally info, $\Delta t$ vs. $t$, etc.
    \item Lineout etc. use PyTables to store HDF5 data and metadata
  \end{itemize}

  High-level ``glue'' written in Python:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Flux-limited diffusion
    \item Linearization scheme
    \item Multigrid management
    \item Time-dependent ``events''
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}
