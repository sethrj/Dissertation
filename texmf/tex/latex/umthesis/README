LaTeX class file in conformance with the specifications set by the 
University of Michigan for dissertations
This class loads the standard book class and then modifies it as little as 
possible. Many of the modifications were taken from the beavtex class and
the umdiss.cls

Before using, please read the introductory comments in the umthesis.cls file
and look at the example.tex file, which is also highly commented. A compiled
example.pdf is also provided, which illustrates many of the features of the
class.

INSTALLATION
You can simply keep the class file in the same directory as your dissertation,
or if you prefer, you can put it somewhere tex will find it (under texmf)
and then run 
texhash
to tell tex you added something
