\subsection{Improved discontinuity treatment}
In the derivation of the anisotropic diffusion method, we discarded
terms of $O(\epsilon^2)$ using the following scaling of Eq.~\eqref{eq:capPsiVol}:
\begin{equation*}
  \Big[ \underbrace{\frac{1}{c}\pder{}{t}}_{O(\epsilon^2)}
  + \underbrace{\vec{\Omega}\vd \grad}_{O(\epsilon^2)}
  + \underbrace{\sigma}_{O(1)} \Big]
   \underbrace{\left( \Iv
  - \frac{1}{4\pi} \phi \right)}_{O(1)}
  = \frac{1}{4\pi}  \underbrace{\grad \vd\vec{F}}_{O(\epsilon^2)} -
  \frac{1}{4\pi} \vec{\Omega}\vd  \underbrace{\grad \phi}_{O(\epsilon)}\,.
\end{equation*}
If we instead take the scaling that $I - \frac{1}{4\pi}\phi=
O(\epsilon)$, which is true for the traditional diffusion scaling, then:
\begin{equation*}
  \Big[ \underbrace{\frac{1}{c}\pder{}{t}}_{O(\epsilon^2)}
  + \underbrace{\vec{\Omega}\vd \grad}_{O(\epsilon^2)}
  + \underbrace{\sigma}_{O(1)} \Big]
   \underbrace{\left( \Iv
  - \frac{1}{4\pi} \phi \right)}_{O(\epsilon)}
  = \frac{1}{4\pi}  \underbrace{\grad \vd\vec{F}}_{O(\epsilon^2)} -
  \frac{1}{4\pi} \vec{\Omega}\vd  \underbrace{\grad \phi}_{O(\epsilon)}\,,
\end{equation*}
where the $O(\epsilon^2)$ terms must be retained:
\begin{equation*}
  \Big[ \vec{\Omega}\vd \grad
  + \underbrace{\sigma} \Big]
   \left( \Iv - \frac{1}{4\pi} \phi \right)
  = \frac{1}{4\pi}  \grad \vd\vec{F}
 - \frac{1}{4\pi} \vec{\Omega}\vd  \grad \phi + O(\epsilon^3)\,.
\end{equation*}
Inverting the left-hand side, expanding the resulting nonlocal unknowns about
the local point and discarding small terms, we arrive at a different
approximation to the radiative intensity than given in
Chapter~\ref{chap:adDerivation}:
\begin{equation*}
  \Iv = \frac{1}{4\pi} \phi - f(\vec{x},\vec{\Omega}) \vec{\Omega}\vd  \grad \phi 
  + f(\vec{x},\vec{\Omega})\grad \vd\vec{F} \,.
\end{equation*}
The first angular moment is a new approximation:
\begin{equation*}
  \vec{F} = - \Dtens \vd \grad \phi + \vec{E} (\grad \vd\vec{F})\,,
\end{equation*}
where
\begin{equation*}
  \vec{E} = \int_{4\pi} \vec{\Omega} f \ud\Omega\,.
\end{equation*}
Away from material discontinuities, $\vec{E}$ is exponentially small; but
near a discontinuity, $\vec{E}$ is non-negligible. This additional term may
improve the accuracy of the anisotropic diffusion approximation in asymptotic
sense, but it will re-introduce a qualitative property that our anisotropic
diffusion approximation lacks: a ``kink'' in the solution $\phi$. Because
$\vec{E}$ is discontinuous at a material boundary, it will induce a
discontinuity in $\grad \phi$.

\subsection{Alternative flux limiters}

In \S\ref{sec:flad}, we proposed a flux-limited modification to anisotropic
diffusion theory. For ease of understanding and implementation, we chose a
``max'' limiter that multiplied the tensor by a scalar that preserved the
physical property $\vec{F} \le \phi$. However, other flux limiting
methods---some of which may be more well behaved numerically---are possible. The
two properties a flux-limited diffusion tensor $\tilde\Dtens$ must retain are
that:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item it must reduce to the true, transport-calculated $\Dtens$ in the absence
    of strong gradients; and
  \item in the presence of strong gradients it must satisfy $ \norm{
    \tilde\Dtens \vd \grad \phi} = \phi$.
\end{enumerate}
Because the anisotropic diffusion coefficient is, in multiple spatial
dimensions, a rank-2 tensor, there is a degree of flexibility not present in
standard diffusion theory. For instance, suppose that we write

\subsection{Higher-order anisotropic \texorpdfstring{\PN}{PN} methods}
The conceptualization of an anisotropic transport equation opens the door to
any number of potential approximations to radiation transport.

For example, instead of defining the anisotropic intensity as $I -
\frac{1}{4\pi}\phi$, we could also subtract off the linearly anisotropic
component:
\begin{equation*}
  \Psi' \equiv I - \frac{1}{4\pi}\phi - \frac{3}{4\pi} \vec{\Omega} \vd
  \vec{F}\,.
\end{equation*}
We could then perform a similar analysis that in chapter~\ref{chap:adDerivation}
and get an approximate form for the second moment of the intensity,
\begin{equation*}
  \int_{4\pi} \vec{\Omega}\vec{\Omega} I \ud \Omega
  = \int_{4\pi} \vec{\Omega}\vec{\Omega} \Psi' \ud \Omega \,.
\end{equation*}
This would be substituted into the first moment of the transport equation,
\begin{equation*}
  \frac{1}{c}\pder{\vec{F}}{t}
  + \vec{\Omega} \vd \int_{4\pi} \vec{\Omega}\vec{\Omega} I \ud \Omega
  + \sigma \vec{F}
  = 0 \,.
\end{equation*}
It would almost certainly involve higher-order gradients of $\phi$ and $\vec{F}$
as well as more complex tensors.
