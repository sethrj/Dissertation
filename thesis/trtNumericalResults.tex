\chapter{Numerical Results: Thermal Radiative Transfer}
\label{chap:trtNumericalResults}

For these numerical simulations, we compare the results of several methods. All
are implemented in the \pytrt\ research code \cite{Pytrt}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\paragraph{Implicit Monte Carlo} Fleck and Cummings' gray IMC method
\cite{Fle1971} is used with $10^7$ particles, implicit absorption, source
tilting, census combing \cite{Urb2006}, and energy-weighted path length tallies.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\paragraph{Anisotropic methods} Because the opacity is a time-dependent quantity
in TRT, the anisotropic diffusion coefficients must be recalculated at every
time step. The first time step still uses 100 source iteration sweeps to
calculate the coefficients, but each time step thereafter uses only one sweep to
update them. (Because the transport problem for $f$ is purely absorbing, one
sweep is sufficient to converge the diffusion coefficients in the interior.)

The profile of energy deposition in the wall is an important diagnostic in the
radiation hydrodynamics problem relevant to the CRASH program \cite{HolCom2011}.
