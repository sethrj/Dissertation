\chapter{Numerical Results: Thermal Radiative Transfer}
\label{chap:trtNumericalResults}

Thermal radiative transfer, as we discussed at length in
Chapter~\ref{chap:trtBackground}, is more complex than linear particle transport
in several respects. The radiation source and absorption terms are coupled to a
material temperature field, and the material temperature determines the opacity.
The problem's physical properties are therefore time-dependent, which
imposes the extra requirement that the anisotropic diffusion coefficients be
recalculated at every time step.

We test a wide range of TRT problems, beginning with diffusive 1-D problems that
contain temperature-dependent opacities. In addition to testing multi-D problems
with optically thin channels, we compare the performance of the anisotropic
methods against conventional methods using standard 2-D TRT benchmark problems.
%We also assess the performance of the methods in a realistic problem of
%interest.

Most of the methods we compare are described at the start of
Chapter~\ref{chap:simpleNumericalResults}, but the following methods need
further discussion when applied to TRT:
\begin{description}

  \item[Monte Carlo] is replaced by Implicit Monte Carlo \cite{Fle1971}. Our
    implementation uses implicit absorption, source tilting, census combing, and
    energy-weighted path length tallies \cite{Urb2006}. Each problem uses
    roughly $10^7$ particles per time step.

  \item[Anisotropic methods] Because the opacity is a time-dependent quantity
in TRT, the anisotropic diffusion coefficients must be recalculated at every
time step. The first time step still uses 100 source iteration sweeps to
calculate the coefficients, but each time step thereafter uses only one sweep to
update them. (Because the transport problem for $f$ is purely absorbing, one
sweep is sufficient to converge the diffusion coefficients in the interior.)

  \item[\Pone-like methods] A known shortcoming of \Pone\ is that, in
    multidimensional geometry with steep gradients, the radiation can have a
    negative solution. To prevent unphysical negative temperatures, we
    ``fix'' non-positive values for the radiation by setting them
    to $10^{-16}$, violating conservation by adding energy to the problem.

\end{description}

\section{1-D Marshak wave}\label{sec:trtOned}
We begin by testing a simple one-dimensional slab geometry problem on a refined
spatial and temporal grid. The anisotropic diffusion approximation is less
meaningful in 1-D: the rank-2 tensor becomes a scalar. Nevertheless, the AD
coefficient is still nonlocal and distinct from the standard diffusion
coefficient.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Problem description}
This ``diffusive'' test problem has been used to assess the
performance of flux limiters and nonlinear convergence schemes
\cite{Rau2005,Ols2007}. It features a smooth but
localized energy peak as an initial condition in both the material and the
radiation:
\begin{equation*}
  \phi(x,0) = [ a c T(x,0)]^{4} = 0.001 + 100 \eexp^{-100 x^2} \,.
\end{equation*}
The material is uniform with a constant $c_v = 1$ and a temperature-dependent
opacity $\sigma(T) = T^{-3}$. We use a uniform spatial and temporal grid of
$\Delta_x = \Delta_t = 0.01$. The boundaries at $x=0$ and $x=3$ are reflecting.

The problem uses a scaled unit system often seen in TRT methods development: $c
= a = 1$. The anisotropic diffusion coefficients are calculated with a
Gauss--Legendre $S_{16}$ quadrature set and the step characteristics method.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Results and discussion}

The radiation temperature, defined as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:radTemp}
  T_\text{rad} = \left( \frac{\phi}{ac} \right)^{1/4}
\end{equation}
is often used in lieu of the radiation density in TRT problem analysis, as it
can be more closely compared against the material temperature $T$. At
thermal equilibrium, just as $I = B = \frac{1}{4\pi} acT^4$, the radiation
temperature satisfies $T_\text{rad} = T$.

The radiation and material temperatures at the simulation end time are plotted
in Fig.~\ref{fig:1dblastTemp}.

\end{figure}

The wavefront position (Fig.~\ref{fig:1dblastWavefront}) provides an effective
visualization of the problem's time evolution. The position is calculated at
each point in time by taking the radiation temperature, convolving it with a
weighted five-point kernel to smooth out potential noise in the solution, and
using linear interpolation to find the point at which the radiation temperature
is twice the initial temperature of the problem.

  \caption{Wavefront position of $\phi$ in 1-D blast wave problem.}
  \label{fig:1dblastWavefront}
\end{figure}

This one-dimensional problem contains certain features that are also manifested
in higher-dimensional geometries, so it serves as a useful introduction to the
behavior of the different methods tested.

First, we note how Fig.~\ref{fig:1dblastWavefront}
shows that, during the streaming-dominated early times, both standard diffusion
and anisotropic diffusion display an unphysical wave speed. For these methods,
the slope of the wavefront position near $t=0$ exceeds $c=1$: energy is being
transferred through the system faster than the speed of light. It is this
shortcoming that motivated the development of both flux-limited diffusion
(\S\ref{sec:bgFld}) and our flux-limited anisotropic diffusion
(\S\ref{sec:flad}). Both the standard \Pone\ and anisotropic \Pone\ are wave
equations, but they have the incorrect wave speed of $c/\sqrt{3}$.

Both \Pone-like methods share a characteristic, unphysical wavefront shape.
The radiation pulse at the beginning, with its steep spatial gradients,
induces a wave-like pulse of particles that travel through the problem. The
\APone\ approximation, because it uses a non-local
$\varsigma$ rather than a local $\sigma$, is smoother: the wavefront's ``hump''
is not as peaked, but the larger $\varsigma$ retards the propagation.

Flux-limited diffusion matches the transport solution very closely in this
problem: the gradients in the interior are small, the radiation is predominantly
isotropic, and the difficulties with streaming are overcome by the flux limiter.
However, at later times, the wavefront drops off more abruptly than the
transport solution.

Flux-limited anisotropic diffusion better matches the wavefront position and
shape of the transport solution. However, near $x=0$, the temperature is too
high: the AD coefficients are smaller than the diffusion coefficients
because of their nonlocal nature, so the radiation behind the wavefront tends to
be less homogeneous than in the standard FLD solution.

%We also note that this problem was 

Overall, in this simple problem, the flux-limited methods match the transport
solution most closely. (The problem was after all constructed to test the
relative performance of flux-limited diffusion.) The standard diffusion
and AD methods allow radiation to travel too quickly through the problem,
resulting in wavefront positions unrealistically far into the problem. The
\Pone\ methods fail to match even the qualitative shape of the solution.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Flatland pipe}
%\section{Ceci est pas une pipe}

For most transport approximations, the extension from one to multiple
dimensions is nontrivial. In the case of anisotropic diffusion, as we saw, the
diffusion coefficient becomes a diffusion tensor, necessitating new
discretization schemes. At the same time, the added complexity inherent
to anisotropic
diffusion gives it an advantage relative to standard diffusion.

The practical extension of flux-limited diffusion to multi-D is straightforward,
but the theory is less sound: most flux limiters are derived under
the assumption of 1-D radiation behavior. In multiple dimensions, the
anisotropic diffusion methods may gain additional traction relative to FLD
because their smaller diffusion coefficients reduce the necessity for flux
limiting.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Problem description}

Our first multi-D test problem for thermal radiative transfer is loosely based
on the problem of interest to the Center for Radiative Shock Hydrodynamics
(CRASH) program: radiation traveling down an optically thin channel with
optically thick walls. Rather than using physical coefficients, we use the same
unitless system as in the 1-D test problem, $c=a=1$.

As represented in Fig.~\ref{fig:crashaltMaterials}, this flatland problem
consists of:
\begin{itemize}
  \item a radiation source region with an energy emission rate density $q_r=25$, 
    a constant opacity $\sigma=0.5$, and a constant heat capacity $c_v=0.5$;
  \item a small channel region with $\sigma = T^{-3}$ and $c_v=1.0$; and
  \item a diffusive region with $\sigma = 25 T^{-3}$ and $c_v=2.5$.
\end{itemize}
The physical properties of the channel are the same as those in the 1-D test
problem.

\begin{figure}[htb!]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=3in]{trt_crashpipealt/materials}
  \Caption{Materials, geometry, and grid spacing in the flatland pipe problem.}{
   Each ``cell'' shown on the grid encompasses $5\times5$ cells in the actual
   numerical simulation. The green zone is the radiation source, the red zone is
 the channel, and the blue zone is the diffusive region.}
  \label{fig:crashaltMaterials}
\end{figure}

The time step is piecewise linear: it increases from $\Delta_t=0.002$ at $t=0$
to $\Delta_t=0.02$ at $t=0.1$, and stays constant thereafter. (Keeping the
time step small at the beginning is a technique used to improve the
performance of the flux limiters and reduce the linearization error during the
initial strong temperature gradients.) The mesh size used
is $\Delta_x=\Delta_y=0.02$. The initial condition is uniformly $\phi = T^4 = 0.001$, and
the problem is run until time $t=3$. All problem boundaries are reflecting.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Results and discussion}

In this problem, the constant radiation source at the left end of the channel
drives the problem. At the beginning, the entire problem is optically thick
(even the channel has the initial opacity $\sigma=0.001^{-4/3}$) and quickly
heats up as it absorbs the radiation from the source. As it heats up, it becomes
thinner: the lower heat capacity and optical thinness of the channel cause it to
become transparent more quickly than the surrounding region. Energy flows
from the radiation source through the channel, and from the channel into the
surrounding diffusive region.

Two lineouts of the material temperatures at the final state are plotted in
Fig.~\ref{fig:crashaltMattemp}.

\end{figure}
%
The standard diffusion approximation performs
poorly: like in the 1-D problem, it allows energy to move too quickly through
the problem. Yet unlike in the 1-D problem, standard flux-limited diffusion also
performs poorly. As seen by comparing the centerline
(Fig.~\ref{fig:crashaltMattempCenter}) and orthogonal
(Fig.~\ref{fig:crashaltMattempOrtho}) views, flux-limited diffusion artificially
constrains the movement of energy into the surrounding opaque materials,
preferring instead to heat the channel and further propagate energy in that
direction. This is not entirely unexpected: flux limiters cannot approximate the
full angular dependence of the intensity; they only restrict the flow of energy
\emph{based on the local spatial gradients}. The gradients at the cold--hot
material interface in the diffusive material are strong, so the flow of
radiation is limited.

Compared to the conventional methods, the new anisotropic methods perform quite
well. The similarity between the AD and FLAD answers suggest that, as
anticipated, the flux limiter used less in the case of anisotropic diffusion.

The behavior of the anisotropic methods relative to conventional
diffusion can be better understood by viewing the magnitude of the
diffusion coefficients and anisotropic diffusion tensor.
Figure~\ref{fig:crashaltDcoeff} shows the diffusion coefficients
of FLAD, FLD, and standard diffusion at the final state. (The components of the
FLAD tensor are plotted separately.)
The anisotropic diffusion tensor
remains consistently smaller than the diffusion coefficients, slowing down the
radiative transfer even compared to flux-limited diffusion. We also note that in
most of the problem, the off-diagonal component of the AD tensor $D^{xy}$ is
much smaller than the corresponding $xx$ and $yy$ components: the
temperature-dependent opacity in the problem is nearly symmetric about the line
$y=1$.

The anisotropy of the problem is plotted in Fig.~\ref{fig:crashaltAnisotropy}.
This metric is defined by:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:anisotropyMetric}
  \text{anisotropy} = \frac{\abs{\lambda_1 - \lambda_2} }{ \sqrt{
  \lambda_1^2 + \lambda_2^2} }\,,
\end{equation}
where $\lambda$ are the eigenvalues of the diffusion tensor $\Dtens$. An
isotropic diffusion tensor is proportional to the identity matrix, so its
eigenvalues are equal, giving an anisotropy of zero. A tensor that only allows
diffusion along one axis (i.e., $\lambda_2 = 0$) would have an anisotropy of
unity. In this problem, the AD method produces strongly anisotropic coefficients
in the channel.
%abs(eigenvalues[0] - eigenvalues[1])/ sqrt( * (eigenvalues[0]^2 +eigenvalues[1]^2) )

\begin{figure}[htb]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=3in]{trt_crashpipealt/anisotropy}
  \Caption{Anisotropy of the flatland pipe problem.}{
    In white regions, the FLAD tensor is isotropic, and in red regions, it is
  highly anisotropic.}
  \label{fig:crashaltAnisotropy}
\end{figure}

Because the problem is driven by a constant spatial source rather than a pulsed
initial condition, the gradients are smoother than in the 1-D Marshak wave
problem, and the \Pone\ and \APone methods perform much better. In fact, the
\APone\ and FLAD methods are qualitatively very close, as are the \Pone\ and FLD
methods.

Finally, a plot of the wavefront location along the channel centerline
(Fig.~\ref{fig:crashaltWavefront}) provides a comparison of the methods over a
broader range of times.
%

  \input{trt_crashpipealt/wavefront-center/plot}
  \caption{Wavefront position of $\phi$ in the flatland pipe problem.}
  \label{fig:crashaltWavefront}
\end{figure}
%
Both the diffusion and AD methods initially push energy too quickly into the
channel, but the more moderate AD coefficients naturally limit the speed after
that point. Only during the initial $\sim0.5$ units of time are the slopes of the
FLAD- and AD-calculated wavefront positions different, demonstrating that
flux limiting is most important at the initial times and less so thereafter.

We more quantitatively test our expectation (\S\ref{sec:flad}) that the more
moderate AD coefficients would require less limiting than standard diffusion.
Using this flatland pipe problem, we run both anisotropic diffusion and
standard diffusion with a ``max'' limiter. (The rest of our problems use the
``square root'' limiter.) When the cell-average flux exceeds the cell-average
$\phi$, the limiter not only modifies the diffusion coefficient/tensor but also
increments a counter. In Fig.~\ref{fig:crashaltFld}, we plot the fraction of
cells that required limiting as a function of time. As a reminder, the
relatively thin channel comprises 10\% of the problem, and the problem contains
$10\,000$ cells total.

  \input{trt_crashpipealt/fld/plot}
  \caption{Application of flux limiters for anisotropic and standard diffusion
  in the flatland pipe problem.}
  \label{fig:crashaltFld}
\end{figure}


We note that this problem was also solved with the AD coefficients calculated on
a coarse grid, as discussed in \S\ref{sec:coarseGridAdCoeff}. Even though the
wall time for the calculation was significantly decreased, errors on the order
of 10\% or more were introduced in the solution. In the steady-state calculation
of AD coefficients, material boundaries are well-defined, so a coarse grid may
be easily chosen that shares those boundaries. With nonlinear opacities, the
boundary between high- and low-opacity materials changes at every time step,
preventing the na\"ive imposition of a coarse grid.

This test problem has demonstrated the feasibility of the anisotropic diffusion
approximations to outperform conventional methods in multi-dimensional
TRT problems. The strongly anisotropic diffusion tensor approximates the flow of
radiation through the channel better than the conventional isotropic diffusion
coefficient.

\section{Crooked pipe}

To add additional complexity, we modified the flatland pipe problem by adding
two bends in it and adjusting the physical coefficients to more closely resemble
the ``crooked pipe'' problem from Ref.~\cite{Gen2001}.

\subsection{Problem description}

This ``crooked pipe'' or ``dogleg'' problem (Fig.~\ref{fig:doglegMaterials})
%
\begin{figure}[htb]
  \centering
  \includegraphics{trt_dogleg/materials-enhanced}
  \Caption{The crooked pipe problem configuration.}{

  indicate an isotropic incident radiation boundary. The centerlines of the
  three legs are shown with a dotted line; the four fiducial points are circled.}

\end{figure}
%
uses flatland geometry rather than the $r$-$z$ geometry typically seen in
pipe/obstacle problems. The problem consists of an optically thin
streaming region embedded in an optically thick diffusive region. The thin
``pipe'' has a very small heat capacity and opacity: $c_v=0.01$ and
$\sigma=0.25T^{-3}$. The diffusive region has $c_v=5$ and $\sigma=200 T^{-3}$.
The pipe has a width of 0.2 (although, because of the reflecting boundary at
the top of the problem, it represents a channel with width 0.4 at that point);
the legs are 1.0, 0.8, and 1.0 units long.

As with the previous scaled problem, the material and radiation temperatures
have a uniform initial condition of $\phi = [ac T]^4 = 0.001$, and $a=c=1$. The
problem is driven by an isotropic boundary source on the left edge of the pipe
with an incident radiation temperature $T_\text{rad} = 5^{1/4}$. The top
boundary is reflecting, and all other boundaries are vacuum.

The chosen grid width is $\Delta_x = 0.02$. The problem runs until $t=10$, with
a time step that scales linearly from 0.002 at $t=0$ to 0.01 at $t=5$ and
remains constant thereafter. (Small time steps were needed at the beginning to
prevent IMC, and other methods to a lesser extent, from violating the maximum
principle. See Ref.~\cite{Lar1987} for a discussion of the maximum principle.)

The analysis will primarily consider segments along the channel (dashed lines
in Fig.~\ref{fig:doglegMaterials}) and certain fiducial points in the channel
representative of the radiation behavior over time. These $x$-$y$ points,
circled in Fig.~\ref{fig:easymkMaterials}, are: $(0.1, 1.0)$, $(0.9, 1.0)$,
$(0.9, 0.3)$, and $(1.7, 0.3)$.

\subsection{Results and discussion}

With the semi-implicit linearization, the problem is highly scattering. In the
final time step, the Fleck factor [see Eq.~\eqref{eq:fleckFactor}] is about
$0.09$ in the channel and $0.06$ in in the diffusive medium: the effective
scattering ratio $\sigma_\text{es}/\sigma$ is above $0.9$ throughout the
problem. (Our particular choice of $\sigma \propto T^{-3}$ and $c_v \propto 1$
means that the linearization coefficient $\beta$ [see Eq.~\eqref{eq:beta}] is
temperature-independent inside each material.)

Figure~\ref{fig:doglegRadtempFinal} plots the radiation temperature at the final

\end{figure}
state $t=10$ for the reference solution (IMC), the flux-limited diffusion
solution (FLD), and the flux-limited anisotropic solution (FLAD). Clearly, the
additional complicated features introduced in this problem cause the solution
methods to approximate the result far differently than in the simple 1-D case of
\S\ref{sec:trtOned}.

This problem has the same qualitative behavior as the previous flatland pipe
problem. One notable difference is that the smaller heat capacity more tightly
couples the radiation and material temperatures: the incident radiation heats
the material in the channel more quickly.

The choice of a boundary source rather than an interior source further
differentiates the anisotropic diffusion methods from the conventional diffusion
methods (see Fig.~\ref{fig:doglegRadtemp1}). Because the conventional and

%
boundary is significantly different. The flatter slope of the standard
diffusion methods (due to the very large $D$) strongly effects the rate at which
radiation penetrates the problem: even with a flux limiter, diffusion
overestimates the amount of radiation that streams through the channel.

An additional complication is the strongly multi-dimensional layout of this
problem. The true transport solution (IMC) shows highly collimated radiation
that streams through the channel impacting the obstacle at $x=1$, heating it
strongly. The limited approximations of standard diffusion do not take this into
account at all: radiation flows isotropically through the bends with nary a care
for the obstacle. Flux-limited anisotropic diffusion captures some of the
anisotropic distribution of the intensity, driving energy into the obstacle and
heating it up. The smaller diffusion coefficients cause the surrounding
diffusive regions to heat up more than with FLD. However, only the transport
method (IMC) is able to capture the full multi-dimensional aspects of the
solution. In Fig.~\ref{fig:doglegRadtemp2}, for example, there is a sudden
drop-off in the IMC solution at $y=0.8$ along the centerline of leg 2: this is
at the bottom edge of the first leg, where the relatively opaque diffusive
region blocks radiation from the boundary source. Only transport can truly
model that the primary source of particles into the second leg is by radiative
emission from the heated wall. (The channel has a very small $\sigma$, meaning
its emission term $\sigma a c T^4$ is also small.) Diffusion and anisotropic
diffusion only approximate this effect by allowing particles to diffuse around
corners.

To better compare the time-dependent behavior of the methods, we turn to
the radiation temperature as a function of time at the first and second fiducial
points (Fig.~\ref{fig:doglegFiducial}). As discussed before, the diffusion and
%

%
AD solutions allow radition to travel unphysically fast: the radiation
temperature for these methods rises sooner than the other methods. The rate of
the temperture rise in all three anisotropic methods is much closer to that of
the transport solution. Even though anisotropic diffusion allows too much
radiation into the second leg, it provides a much closer approximation to the
transport solution.

In Fig.~\ref{fig:doglegFiducialAll} we have overlaid the reference solution

%
(IMC), flux-limited diffusion, and flux-limited anisotropic diffusion at all
four representative points. The leading tail in FLD and FLAD is an artifact of
the temporal discretization error. The IMC and FLAD show good agreement at the
first two points for nearly all times, but after the first bend in the problem,
the accuracy of FLAD suffers. The FLD approximation allows energy to travel
through the problem far too rapidly: its calculated solution in the pipe is
nearly constant by $t=2$, whereas the transport solution does not show radiation
heating the final point until $t=5$.

In Table~\ref{tab:doglegTiming} we compare the amount of computer time taken
for each of the problems. The cost of one transport sweep per time step adds
only a ~50\% performance penalty. Given the results shown above, we believe
that additional computing time to be well spent.

In this test problem, the anisotropic diffusion methods consistently produce
more accurate solutions than the standard diffusion methods with only a small
increase in computing time. The flux limiter
(FLAD) further improves the result by reducing the speed of the initial
radiation wave. As seen in the previous flatland pipe problem, the \APone\
approximation yields solutions similar to those of FLAD. None of the approximate
methods can exactly reproduce the transport solution, but by all metrics the new
anisotropic diffusion methods are significantly closer to the transport solution
than conventional diffusion methods.

One might argue that the previous flatland problems are particularly suited to
the
anisotropic approximations. How then does the method perform on other problems
without simple, optically thin channels in a thicker medium? To answer this

Ref.~\cite{Kno2007}), contains two square obstacles in 2-D geometry (not
flatland) that impede a front of
radiation emitted by a boundary source. It is a
two-dimensional problem on the domain $0 \le x \le 2$, $0 \le y \le 1$ with
$\Delta_x=\Delta_y=1/32$. The
problem has a uniform heat capacity $c_v = 1$, and the opacity is
$\sigma=T^{-3}$ everywhere except inside two obstacles, where $\sigma= 1.5
T^{-3}$. These obstacles are squares of width $5/8$, with lower-left corners
at $(3/16, 3/16)$ and $(19/16, 3/16)$.

The top and bottom boundaries are reflecting; on the left of the problem is an
isotropic incident radiation source with $T_\text{rad} = 5^{1/4}$, and the right
side of the problem has a vacuum boundary. The initial condition is $\phi =
T^{4} = 0.001$.

In Ref.~\cite{Mou2006}, the problem halts at $t=3$; for the sake of completeness we
compare the convergence of the solutions until $t=8$ in
Fig.~\ref{fig:easymkConvergence}. We use a uniform time step $\Delta_t=0.01$.

We use a ``level-symmetric'' Chebyshev--Legendre S$_{16}$ quadrature set for
calculating the AD coefficients. (This quadrature set uses a Gauss--Legendre
quadrature to obtain polar angles, and Chebyshev--Gauss quadratures for the
azimuthal directions, with fewer azimuthal ordinates with increasing polar
level.)

\subsection{Results and discussion}

The radiation source on the left 

Qualitatively, flux-limited diffusion and flux-limited anisotropic diffusion
perform equally well (Fig.~\ref{fig:easymkContour}). Whereas FLD contains spatial gradients that are slightly
too steep, FLAD is unnaturally smooth due to its smoother anisotropic diffusion
coefficients.

\end{figure}

A more detailed comparison of the methods at the intermediate time $t=3$
(Fig.~\ref{fig:easymkCenterline}) shows that the IMC reference solution agrees
with the conventional FLD more closely inside the obstacle, but FLAD gives a
better result in the channel.

  \caption{Solution along the centerline at $t=3$ in the easy obstacle

  \label{fig:easymkCenterline}
\end{figure}

To provide a quantitative comparison of the
methods, we have compared the difference in the temperature (volume-weighted
relative 2-norm) between each method and the reference solution as a function of
time (Fig.~\ref{fig:easymkConvergence}).
This metric,
\begin{equation*}
  \text{reported difference} =
  \left[ \sum_{i \in \text{cells}} \left(
  \frac{T_i}{T_{i,\text{reference}}} - 1 \right)^2 (V_i)^2\right]^{1/2} \,.
\end{equation*}
is similar to Eq.~\eqref{eq:rel2norm} used in the previous chapter.
From the plotted relative differences, it appears that the most accurate method
overall is flux-limited anisotropic diffusion. Diffusion is the least accurate,
and the \APone\ and \Pone\ methods perform similarly.

  \input{trt_easymk/convergence-mattemp/plot}
  \caption{Relative difference of the material temperature in the easy obstacle
  problem, compared against IMC.}
  \label{fig:easymkConvergence}
\end{figure}

In this problem, our new anisotropic methods do not notably outperform the
conventional diffusion-based methods. However, they do not give
unrealistic/highly inaccurate answers as standard diffusion can give in
pipe-like problems. Anisotropic diffusion can be an improvement over standard
diffusion in some but not all problems.

\section{2-D \texorpdfstring{``hard''}{hard} obstacle problem}

A second problem from Ref.~\cite{Mou2006} has steeper spatial gradients and
large voided regions: it should therefore be outside the comfort zone of
both conventional and anisotropic diffusion methods.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Problem description}

The ``hard'' obstacle problem has the 2-D domain $0 \le x,y \le 1$ and uses a
cell width $\Delta_x=\Delta_y=1/64$. The heat capacity is uniform, $c_v=1$, and
the opacity is $\sigma=T^{-3}$ outside of two square obstacles, which have
$\sigma=10 T^{-3}$. The square obstacles, each of which has a width of $1/4$, are
stationed with lower-left corners at $(3/16, 9/16)$ and $(9/16,3/16)$.

\begin{figure}[htb]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[height=2.25in]{trt_hardmk/materials}
  \Caption{Problem layout for the ``hard'' obstacle problem.}{
    The red blocks are ten times as opaque than the yellow region at the same
  temperature.}
  \label{fig:hardmkMaterials}
\end{figure}

All energy in the problem comes from the Gaussian initial condition:
\begin{equation*}
  \phi(x,y,0) = [ a c T(x,y,0)]^{4} = 0.001 + 100 \eexp^{-100 (x^2 + y^2) } \,.
\end{equation*}
In the model's unit system, $a=c=1$.

The problem is run until $t=3$. The time step increases linearly from $\Delta_t=.0001$ at
$t=0$ to $\Delta_t=.01$ at $t=1$ and is constant thereafter. To calculate the
anisotropic diffusion coefficients, we use the same Chebyshev--Legendre level
symmetric quadrature set as in the easy obstacle problem.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Results and discussion}

The large optically thick region and the sharp discontinuity in temperature at
the obstacles pose a challenge to all of the approximate methods. As we saw in
the linear test problem of \S\ref{sec:tdBlastwave}, only a transport method is
able to accurately capture the hyperbolic nature of the transport equation. In
Fig.~\ref{fig:hardmkPseudocolor} we have plotted the radiation field at a time
in the problem where the transport effects are particularly visible.
%
\begin{figure}[htb]
  \centering
  \hspace{-1in}%
  \includegraphics[width=5in]{trt_hardmk/radtemp_t25}
  \Caption{Pseudocolor plots of the radiation temperature at $t=2.5$.}{
  The methods compared are: IMC (upper left), FLAD (upper right), FLD (lower
  left), AP1 (lower right). The temperature scale is linear and ranges from
  $0.18$ (white) to $1$ (black).}
  \label{fig:hardmkPseudocolor}
\end{figure}
%
The optically thick obstacles have impeded the flow of radiation, heating up
slowly at their exterior, re-radiating from their outer boundary into the
medium, but preventing radiation from passing through. The radiation streams
through the gap in the middle, at first almost as a mono-directional beam. As it
heats up the upper right section of the problem, isotropic black-body emission
warms the reverse sides of the blocks.

The diffusion methods cannot reproduce the hyperbolic behavior of radiation
streaming through avoid. In the conventional diffusion methods, radiation
diffuses isotropically through the problem: it flows unnaturally around the
obstacles. In Fig.~\ref{fig:hardmkPseudocolor}, this is seen in the FLD solution
(lower left): the more homogeneous radiation field has fully surrounded the
obstacle.

Fig.~\ref{fig:hardmkDiag} gives a more detailed look at the final state.

  \caption{Solution along the diagonal at $t=3$ in the hard obstacle problem.}
  \label{fig:hardmkDiag}
\end{figure}
%
With the exception of \Pone, the approximate methods qualitatively
capture the behavior of the radiation and material temperatures along the
diagonal of the problem. The initial gradient proved too strong for \Pone, which
showed unphysical wavelike behavior throughout the problem. The smoother
coefficients in the \APone\ equation moderate the wavelike behavior, allowing it
to represent the behavior of the radiation more accurately.

This problem demonstrates again that anisotropic diffusion is not a silver
bullet. It is unable to model the hyperbolic behavior of the transport equation,
but at the same time it performs no less poorly than conventional flux-limited
diffusion.

\section{CRASH-like problem}

THIS ISN'T WORKING: I CANNOT EXPLAIN IT. Perhaps, given the quantity and quality
of the other test problems, we should omit this one? I'm meeting with Eric Myra
on 11/21 to discuss my problem and why even the 1-D versions I've created do not
even qualitatively match their numerical results.

The physical opacities in Fig.~\ref{fig:seriousOpacity} are interpolated from a

and a crude temperature model approximates the more realistic model:
\begin{equation*}
  \sigma(T;\gamma,T_1,T_2) =
  \begin{cases}
    \gamma   & T < T_1\,, \\
    \gamma \left( \frac{T}{T_1} \right)^{-3}   & T_1 \le T < T_2\,, \\
    \gamma \left( \frac{T_2}{T_1} \right)^{-3}
    \left( \frac{T}{T_2} \right)^{-1/2}   & T_2 \le T \,.
  \end{cases}
\end{equation*}

The values for $\gamma$, $T_1$, and $T_2$, along with other physical properties
of the materials, are given in Table~\ref{tab:seriousPhysics}. The unit system

\section{Conclusions}

The wide variety of problems we chose to test in this section give a full
picture of the behavior of the anisotropic diffusion methods. Anisotropic
diffusion is consistently able to accurately approximate the flow of radiation
through small voided regions. It does not improve the solution significantly in
problems with large voids where the predominant behavior of the transport
equation is hyperbolic, and it is less effective in 1-D than in multi-D.

In problems with small optically thin regions, the AD method calculates strongly
anisotropic coefficients in those regions. The resulting approximation is
significantly more accurate than conventional diffusion. Applying a flux limiter
to the AD approximation fixes the unphysical violation of the speed of light
seen in early time steps. The anisotropic \Pone\ method in problems with
small voided regions gives answers very close to flux-limited anisotropic
diffusion, but it gives less accurate answers in 1-D and problems with large
voids. Even with that caveat, \APone\ tends to perform better than the standard
\Pone\ approximation.
