\chapter{Numerical Results: Test Problems}\label{chap:simpleNumericalResults}

When solving the anisotropic diffusion equations numerically, the solution
is not just a function of the physical problem: it is affected by the choice
of low-order discretization scheme, the transport discretization used in
calculating the AD coefficients, the transport convergence criteria, and many
other parameters. Furthermore, the added complexity of time dependence and
nonlinear opacities may obscure both the benefits and the shortcomings of the
anisotropic diffusion methods. Additionally, because of the novelty of the
flatland geometry which we use extensively, it is necessary to provide numeric
validation for the flatland boundary conditions derived in
Chapter~\ref{chap:flatland}.

In this chapter, we systematically investigate certain attributes particular to
anisotropic diffusion (AD), flux-limited anisotropic diffusion (FLAD), and
anisotropic \Pone\ (\APone) by analyzing their behavior in simple steady-state
and time-dependent problems. Most of these problems emulate attributes of
realistic thermal radiative transfer problems, viz.~high scattering ratios and
optically thin regions surrounded by optically thick regions.

Our numerical simulations are executed with several existing methods as well
as the new anisotropic diffusion methods. All
are implemented in the \pytrt\ research code \cite{Pytrt}. Unless otherwise
noted, we use the following solver parameters with each method.
\begin{description}
  \item[The Monte Carlo method] functions as our benchmark transport method. Our
    implementation uses stratified sampling of source regions, and weight
    windows that attempt to keep uniform the weight of particles both emitted
    from sources and transported through previous time steps. The solver runs
    $10^7$ particles and uses path length--weighted tallies.

  \item[Standard diffusion] in our implementation uses a cell-centered
    discretization \cite{Dud1976}.  We use ``variational'' rather than
    ``Marshak'' boundary conditions.
    As with the following diffusion-like methods, we explicitly
    construct a sparse matrix that is passed to the Trilinos library
    \cite{Her2003}.  In problems with fewer than 50,000 unknowns, we use the KLU
    direct solver. 

  \item[Time-dependent \Pone] uses the standard ``staggered mesh''
    discretization, where $\phi$ is cell-centered and $\vec{F}$ is
    face-centered.

  \item[Flux-limited diffusion] is implemented with the ``square root'' limiter
    and discretization scheme discussed in \S\ref{sec:bgFld}. The unknowns and
    diffusion coefficients are stored on cell centers.

  \item[Anisotropic diffusion] uses
    coefficients calculated with the diamond difference \SN\ method, using 100
    sweep iterations. In 1-D, we use a Gauss--Legendre quadrature set with 16
    ordinates (S$_{16}$); in flatland, we use a Chebyshev--Gauss quadrature set
    (see \S\ref{sec:flatlandQuadrature}) with 64 ordinates (S$_{32}$). As
    with FLD, the opacities, diffusion coefficients, and unknowns are
    cell-centered. We use the nine-point stencil given in
    \S\ref{sec:cellAnisoA}. The low-order boundary conditions use the
    variational extrapolation distance 

  \item[Flux-limited anisotropic diffusion] is implemented with the
    ``max'' limiter described in \S\ref{sec:flad} using the flux limiter
    discretization of \S\ref{sec:bgFld}. It is otherwise treated identically to
    the above anisotropic diffusion method.

  \item[Anisotropic \Pone] uses the same ``staggered mesh'' discretization
    as \Pone, and in all other aspects it is identical to the other anisotropic
    methods.

\section{Analysis of non-analytic AD coefficients}

In prior work, the anisotropic diffusion coefficients have been calculated using
analytic solutions of $f$ \cite{Lar2009c}. However, in all but the simplest
problems, such solutions are impossible, so we use an \SN\ transport solver to
calculate the coefficients. Because \SN\ is only an approximation to the
transport equation, discretization in both the spatial and angular variables
will affect the calculated diffusion coefficients $\Dtens$, which in turn affect
the anisotropic diffusion solution $\phi$.

To assess the discrepancy in the solution incurred by using discrete transport,
we compare the solutions of a simple test problem using \SN-calculated
coefficients and analytically calculated coefficients.  We furthermore compare
the analytic and discrete solutions to a Monte Carlo reference solution, to see
if the discrepancy in the diffusion coefficients truly reduces the accuracy of
the methods.

By varying the number of ordinates in the quadrature set, the spatial
refinement in the \SN\ calculation, the \SN\ convergence criteria, and the
choice of boundary conditions for the calculation of $f$ (reflecting or white),
we can determine acceptable solver parameters for our later, more complex
problems.  A
voided channel surrounded by a diffusive, optically thick medium is
representative of many of our later test problems.

\subsection{Problem description}

The prototypical anisotropic diffusion test problem, a flatland VHTR mock-up due
to Larsen and Trahan \cite{Lar2009c}, consists of voided vertical channels in a
diffusive medium. The diffusive region has $\sigma_d=1$, the channel
$\sigma_c=0.01$. The scattering ratio is uniformly $0.99$.  We will use a small
portion of this problem (Fig.~\ref{fig:ssSingleXsn}), a single channel of unit
width, with diffusive regions on the left and right each with width 4. The left
and lower boundaries are reflecting, and the right and upper boundaries are
vacuum. The source is a Gaussian function,
\begin{equation*}
  q(x,y) = 2 \eexp^{-2 (x^2 + y^2)}\,.
\end{equation*}

\begin{figure}[htb]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=3.5in]{ss_single_channel/xsn.png}
  \Caption{The single channel problem configuration.}{
  The total opacity is plotted in black and white, and the colored region in the
  lower left is the Gaussian source.}
  \label{fig:ssSingleXsn}
\end{figure}

The analytic solution for $f$ is based on the assumption that the channel is
infinite in extent along the $y$ axis, and that the diffusive regions are
infinitely wide. We therefore expect reflecting boundaries on the \SN\ transport
problem for $f$ to produce answers closer to the analytic values, but since the
channel is \emph{not} indeed infinite, reflecting boundaries will not
necessarily produce more accurate answers compared to the reference transport
solution. Using the analytic solution for $f$, we calculate exact solutions for
the anisotropic diffusion coefficient $\Dtens$ from
Eq.~\eqref{eq:flatDDefinition}
as well as boundary coefficient given in Eq.~\eqref{eq:flatAdBoundaryIntegral}:
\begin{equation*}
  \vec{d}(\vec{x}) = -4\int_{\vec{\Omega}\vd\vec{n} < 0}
  V(\abs{\vec{\Omega}\vd\vec{n}})
\vec{\Omega} f(\vec{x}, \vec{\Omega}) \ud\Omega\,.
\end{equation*}

All of the diffusion solutions, even though they may use analytically-calculated
coefficients, are solved using the standard five-point cell-centered diffusion
scheme%
\footnote{%
Because the opacity is symmetric about the $x$ axis, $D^{xy}=0$
throughout the problem; see \S\ref{sec:adLinalg}.
} using a uniform cell width of 0.0625.

\subsection{Solution}
The solution of the problem using four different methods is plotted in
Fig.~\ref{fig:ssSingleContour}. The Monte Carlo solution is the reference
solution.  We have also shown the anisotropic diffusion solutions with
both analytically calculated coefficients and \SN-calculated coefficients. The
latter uses reflecting boundaries on the transport calculation for $f$ with
$10^4$ source iterations. For comparative purposes, we also plot the standard
diffusion solution.

Before exploring the parameter space of \SN\ solver options, we first point out
some features in the solution characteristic of anisotropic diffusion. Unlike
the Monte Carlo and diffusion solutions, which have discontinuities at the
boundary between channel and medium, the anisotropic diffusion solution is
smooth. The AD solution is less accurate near the material boundaries, but along
the centerline of the channel (Fig.~\ref{fig:ssSingleCenterline}) and a few mean
free paths into the medium, it matches the reference solution very closely.

\end{figure}

\subsection{\texorpdfstring{\SN}{SN} parameter convergence}
Figure~\ref{fig:ssSingleAbsConv} plots the convergence of the solution $\phi$
against the solution with analytically-calculated AD coefficients, for four
different combinations of \SN\ solver parameters, as a function of the number of
source iterations (transport sweeps) in the calculation of $f$.

Likewise, figure~\ref{fig:ssSingleQsConv} plots the convergence of the \SN\ 
solution with increasing number of ordinates. The black line shows that refining
the quadrature brings the solution closer to the analytic value, but the red
line demonstrates that it does \emph{not} converge to the Monte Carlo transport
solution.

\begin{figure}[htb]

    \input{ss_single_channel/qsconv/plot}}%
  \Caption{Convergence of $\phi$ as a function of \SN\ parameters.}{
    The AD solution $\phi$ with \SN-calculated coefficients is compared
    against the solution with analytic coefficients using a volume-weighted
    2-norm, as a function of increasing source iterations in the calculation of
    $f$. The red line in (b) shows convergence compared to the Monte Carlo
    solution.}
  \label{fig:ssSingleConv}
\end{figure}

The convergence is calculated using a volume-weighted relative 2-norm:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:rel2norm}
  \text{reported difference} =
  \left[ \sum_{i \in \text{cells}} \left(
  \frac{\phi_i}{\phi_{i,\text{reference}}} - 1 \right)^2 (V_i)^2\right]^{1/2} \,.
\end{equation}
This is \emph{not} the convergence of the transport solution $f$, which only
indirectly affects the $\phi$.
Compared to the reference solution, AD (with analytic coefficients) has a 4.5\%
absolute error and standard diffusion has a 19.8\% error.

The data in Fig.~\ref{fig:ssSingleAbsConv} suggest that with a finite number of
ordinates, which cannot exactly
approximate the angular domain, there is little added benefit to using more than
a few sweeps: the error introduced by the angular approximation overwhelms
the lack of convergence. But Fig.~\ref{fig:ssSingleQsConv} shows that, since
even the analytic AD solution differs from the exact solution by ~5\%, even a
coarse quadrature set can provide accuracy within the inherent limits of the
method.
%Additionally, the choice of reflecting or white boundary conditions has
%little effect on the solution of this problem.

This conclusion may not hold for some problems, of course, but it suggests that
a modest number of ordinates and sweeps are sufficient to yield answers with
close to the accuracy of an analytic anisotropic diffusion solution.

\clearpage
\subsubsection{Coarse spatial grid calculation of \texorpdfstring{$\Dtens$}{D}}

In addition to investigating how the AD solution changes with the granularity of
the angular variable in the solution of $f$, we test the discrepancy
introduced by calculating $f$ on a coarser spatial grid. As discussed in
\S\ref{sec:adSmoothness}, the solution of $f$ is a smooth function of space, and
$\Dtens$ likewise has no discontinuities. We have implemented the basic
multigrid operations of prolongation and restriction in the \pytrt\ code
for cell-centered quantities and quantities on the boundary face \cite{Pytrt}.

%The total opacity is restricted using a volume-weighted harmonic average 
We run the transport calculation for $f$ on a coarse grid and prolongate the
diffusion tensor $\Dtens$ and boundary coefficient $\vec{d}$ back to the fine
grid, where $\phi$
is then solved. With this methodology, the spatial discretization error of the
diffusion solve is unaffected; the only difference is that the diffusion
coefficients are a coarser function of space. Figure~\ref{fig:ssSingleMgD} shows
the resulting coarse anisotropic diffusion coefficients.

\begin{figure}[htb]
  \centering
\subfloat[$D^{xx}$]{%

  \Caption{Calculated diffusion coefficients for different grid coarseness.}{
  Every two units downward represents a factor of four refinement in the
  number of fine cells per coarse cell.}
  \label{fig:ssSingleMgD}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:ssSingleMgConv} plots the error in $\phi$ introduced by using
coarse approximations to the anisotropic diffusion coefficient. (In this
problem, the grid and refinements were chosen so that in the coarsest case, each
coarse cell was composed of a single material.) 
The rightmost data point in the figure has a coarse cell width of
$\Delta_x=0.5$, half the width of the channel.
\begin{figure}[htb]
  \centering
  \input{ss_single_channel/mgconv/plot}
  \caption{Error introduced by coarse spatial grids in calculating the AD
  coefficients.}
  \label{fig:ssSingleMgConv}
\end{figure}
Clearly, in this simple problem with well-defined material boundaries, the
solution is relatively insensitive to using less spatially refined diffusion
coefficients. This is perhaps not surprising, as, for example, the standard
diffusion coefficient has no spatial variation inside a homogeneous material.

The implication of all these results is clear: high-fidelity transport
calculations are \emph{not} needed in calculation of the anisotropic diffusion
coefficients. Because the cost of the transport calculation is
roughly proportional to $
  (\text{the number of transport sweeps}) \times 
  (\text{the number of ordinates}) \times 
  (\text{the number of spatial cells})$,
using only a modest number of sweeps and a small quadrature set with a
coarse-grid calculation can provide a substantial speedup when compared with a
fine-grid calculation that might improve the answer only by a tenth of a
percent. Because we do not expect the anisotropic diffusion approximation to
yield truly transport-quality solutions, and because a high-fidelity transport
calculation requires far more computational effort than a diffusion solve, the
small error incurred by using a coarse transport solution is well worth reducing
the run time by orders of magnitude.

\section{Flatland boundary conditions}

The flatland boundary conditions derived in Chapter~\ref{chap:flatland} must,
for the sake of completeness, be numerically verified. We compare the novel
diffusion boundary conditions against a Monte Carlo reference solution in a
simple, diffusive test problem.

We consider a homogeneous flatland problem with a
total cross section $\sigma=1$ and scattering ratio $c=0.99$. The spatial 
domain is the rectangle $0 \le x \le 2$, $0 \le y \le 10$, with
reflecting boundaries on the left,
right, and top sides. The bottom side has a specified unit incident radiation
flux; we consider three different angular
distributions given in Table~\ref{tab:angularDistributions}.\footnote{These
distributions were chosen because of their prior use in a 1-D boundary
matching analysis in \cite{Dav2006}.}

\begin{table}[htb]
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{ccc}
\toprule
    Distribution & 1-D & Flatland
\\ \midrule
Isotropic & $I(\mu) = \frac{1}{2}$ & $I(\omega) = \frac{\pi}{2}$
\\
Normal & $I(\mu) = \delta(\mu-1)$ & $I(\omega) = \delta(\omega-\pi/2)$
\\
Grazing & $I(\mu) = \delta(\mu-0.1)$ & $I(\omega) = \delta(\omega-\sin\inv.1)$
\\ \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Angular distributions used in boundary condition tests.}
  \label{tab:angularDistributions}
\end{table}

Figure~\ref{fig:flatlandBcDelta},
 a line-out of the scalar flux $\phi_0$ along
$x=1$ for the normally incident boundary, illustrates the differences between
the methods. The diffusion
approximation cannot reproduce the boundary layer that the true transport
solution features, but the variational approximation to the flatland
diffusion boundary condition allows the asymptotic diffusion solution to
closely match the transport solution. The Marshak boundary does not.

Figure~\ref{fig:flatlandBcRelative} quantitatively compares both ``variational'' and
``Marshak'' diffusion boundary conditions against the transport solution
for all three incident distributions.  
As with the variational boundary condition for 3-D geometry, the flatland
variational boundary condition gives an interior scalar flux accurate to within
a few percent. The Marshak condition fails to limit to the transport solution except in
the case of an isotropic boundary source, where only the extrapolation
distance differs from the variational boundary condition.

\end{figure}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Anisotropic diffusion boundary conditions}

In Chapter~\ref{chap:adDerivation}, we derived boundary conditions for the
anisotropic diffusion approximation. These boundary conditions reduce to the
standard diffusion boundary condition in a homogeneous medium, but they were
derived under a different set of asymptotic assumptions. We test the extent of
their applicability using a steady-state flatland test problem similar to the
above.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Boundary source}
The test problem is similar to the above flatland boundary condition test
problem. It features a diffusive medium in flatland on the domain $0
\le x \le 5$ and $0 \le y \le 10$, with a channel of unit width running
vertically through the middle ($2.5 \le x \le 3.5$). The diffusive region has
$\sigma=1$ and $\sigma_s=0.99$, and the channel has $\sigma=0.01$ and
$\sigma_s=0.0099$. The problem has reflecting boundaries on the top, left, and
right sides, and an incident boundary condition on the bottom with unit
incident radiation flux. We consider the same angular distributions as in
Table~\ref{tab:angularDistributions}.

Figure~\ref{fig:isotropic} shows a line-out of the scalar flux $\phi(2.5,y)$,
along the center
of the channel. Standard diffusion fails because $\sigma=0.01$ leads to a very
large diffusion coefficient, resulting in a nearly constant solution inside the
channel. The anisotropic diffusion performs exceedingly well, and the
white boundary condition for $f$ gives a better result than the reflecting
boundary condition.

\begin{figure}[htb!]
  \centering
  \hspace{-.25in}%
  \input{adbc-channel/isotropic-phi/plot}
  \caption{Scalar flux along the centerline of the channel with an isotropic
  boundary condition at $y=0$.}
  \label{fig:isotropic}
\end{figure}

A visualization of the angular flux for each method (replacing Monte Carlo with
an \SN\ solution), Fig.~\ref{fig:bcChannelIsotropicAngular}, helps explain the
accuracy
of the AD method and the difference between the reflecting and white boundary
treatments. Even though AD cannot exactly model the peak of freely streaming
photons in the channel (which the \SN\ angular flux shows at $\omega=3\pi/2$),
it accurately approximates the angular flux shape driven by scattering from the
diffusive region (the lobes on the left and right).
The linear-in-angle diffusion approximation cannot represent any of these
features.  

\begin{figure}[htb]
  \centering\small
  \vspace{-.25in}%
  \hspace{-.25in}%
  \input{adbc-channel/angle-isotropic-cmfp/plot}
  \vspace{-.25in}%
  \caption{Angular flux $\psi(2.5, 1., \omega)$ for the incident isotropic
  problem, in the centerline of the channel one unit from the boundary.}
  \label{fig:bcChannelIsotropicAngular}
\end{figure}

A close examination of the numerical solutions gives some insight into these
results.  AD does not exactly model the peak of freely streaming
photons in the channel, but it does accurately approximate the angular flux
shape driven by scattering from the diffusive regions along the edge of the
channel. 
The standard linear-in-angle diffusion approximation does not accurately
represent these
features.

The shape around $\omega=\pi/2$ gives insight into why the white boundary
performs better in this problem: a reflecting boundary produces a peak in $f$
along the channel, but a white boundary gives a more isotropic shape near that
range, better matching the incident isotropic boundary condition. This suggests
that the qualitatively best way to satisfy Eq.~\eqref{eq:hoBc} may be
to have the incident distribution of $f$ take the shape of the true boundary
condition.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Interior source}

As a more realistic test of the boundary conditions, we consider the same
problem, except instead of a reflecting boundary on top and a source on bottom,
the bottom is reflecting and the top is a vacuum. There is an isotropic
Gaussian-shaped radiation source in the lower-left corner:
\begin{equation*}
  q(x,y) = \pi \eexp^{-2 (x^2 + y^2) } \,.
\end{equation*}
(With this normalization, the volume-integrated source is 2.)
The grid width used is $\Delta_x = 0.1$.

\section{Linear time-dependent behavior}

Before considering the complex nonlinear behavior of TRT, we should
independently analyze how the newly developed methods behave in linear,
time-dependent problems with time-independent opacities.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Reactor}

We devised a time-dependent problem, represented in
Fig.~\ref{fig:tdReactorProblem}, meant to be a case where the temporal and
spatial gradients are moderate but significant enough to distinguish diffusion
from transport. It features a unit source in the bottom left corner of a
diffusive medium of width~$2$ with
$\sigma=1$ and a scattering ratio~$c=.99$. A voided region with width $0.5$,
$\sigma=0.01$, and $c=.99$ lies along the right edge of the problem. The bottom,
left, and right boundaries are reflecting; the top of the problem has a vacuum
boundary.

Because this problem is time-dependent, it is our first test of the anisotropic
\Pone\ method devised in Chapter~\ref{chap:aponeDerivation}. This new method
uses not only the anisotropic diffusion tensors $\Dtens$ but also a nonlocal
opacity $\varsigma$:
\begin{equation}\tagref{eq:ap1FicksLawFinal}
  \frac{1}{c}\pder{\vec{F}}{t}(\vec{x},t)
  + \varsigma(\vec{x}) \Dtens(\vec{x}) \vd \grad \phi(\vec{x}, t)
  + \varsigma(\vec{x})\vec{F}(\vec{x},t) 
  = 0 \,.
\end{equation}
Figure~\ref{fig:tdReactorProblem} overlays these transport-calculated
coefficients on the problem layout.

\begin{figure}[bp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=2in]{td_reactor/xsn}
  \Caption{Time-dependent reactor problem setup.}{
    The source region is the red square in the lower-left; the black
    and white area in the bottom half shows $\sigma$, the colored region above
    shows $\varsigma = 1/\int_{S} f \ud\Omega$, and the ellipses are a
    visualization of the diffusion tensor $\Dtens=\int_{S}
    \vec{\Omega}\vec{\Omega} f \ud\Omega$.}
  \label{fig:tdReactorProblem}
\end{figure}

The anisotropic diffusion tensors are plotted as ellipses, where the major axis
lies along the principal eigenvector of $\Dtens$, and the size of that axis is
proportional to the corresponding eigenvalue. The minor axis is proportional to
the second eigenvalue of the tensor. Where $f$ is isotropic, $\Dtens$ is
proportional to the identity tensor, and its two eigenvalues are equal: thus, in
the interior, the anisotropic diffusion coefficient appears as a circle whose
size is proportional to $1/\sigma$.

The time evolution of $\phi$ along the center of the channel (i.e., at the
right edge of the problem) is plotted in Fig.~\ref{fig:tdReactor}. A contour
plot showing the difference between \Pone\ and \APone\ is given in
Fig.~\ref{fig:tdReactorContour}.

\subsection{Blast wave}

The ``blast wave'' test problem features a localized impulse of radiation; the
magnitude of the coefficients is based on a recurrent test problem in the field
of thermal radiative transfer \cite{Kno1999a,Kno2001,Rau2005,Ols2007}. The
domain of this problem is $0 \le x \le 3$ and $-1.1 \le y \le 1.1$.
It features an optically thin channel with $\sigma=1$ and $\sigma_s=0.99$ inside
$-.1 \le y \le .1$, with a diffusive region $\sigma=10$ and $\sigma_s=9.99$
outside it. All boundaries are specularly reflecting.

The initial condition is a local but smooth Gaussian function:
\begin{equation*}
  \phi(x,y) = 0.001 + a \eexp^{-100 (x^2 + y^2) }\,,
\end{equation*}
where $a$ is a normalization constant that gives a total initial $\int \phi
\ud V$ of $100 + 0.001 V$.
