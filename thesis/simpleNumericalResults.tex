  \caption{Angular distributions used in boundary condition tests.}
  \label{tab:angularDistributions}
\end{table}

As a test problem, we consider a homogeneous flatland problem with a
total cross section $\sigma=1$ and scattering ratio $c=0.99$. It lives on the
domain $0 \le x \le 2$, $0 \le y \le 10$, with reflecting boundaries on the left,
right, and top sides. The bottom side has a specified boundary
condition with unit incident current, and we consider three different angular
distributions.

The first distribution is isotropic, $\psi^b(\theta) = \frac{1}{2}$. The second
is a normally incident flux, with all particles entering
perpendicular to the surface, $\psi^b(\theta) = \delta(\theta -
\frac{\pi}{2})$. The third incident distribution is at a grazing angle, with 
$\psi^b(\theta) = 10 \delta(\theta - \sin^{-1}.1)$.
These are the same angular distributions used in a boundary matching analysis
in \cite{Dav2006}.

Figure~\ref{fig:isotropic} shows a line-out of the scalar flux $\phi_0$ along
$x=1$ for an isotropic incident source. Because the left-hand sides of
Eqs.~\eqref{eq:flatMarshak} and~\eqref{eq:flatVarBc} are the same, the
differences in the solution are only due to the slightly different
extrapolation distance.

However, for the highly anisotropic normal and grazing cases,
Figs.~\ref{fig:delta} and~\ref{fig:grazing}, the Marshak boundary fails to
limit to the transport solution outside of the boundary layer. As
expected, the variational boundary condition does a much better job of
approximating the interior solution of the scalar flux.

\subsection{Steady-state flatland channel}
As a test problem, we consider a diffusive medium in flatland on
the domain $0
\le x \le 5$ and $0 \le y \le 10$, with a channel of unit width running
vertically through the middle. The diffusive region has $\sigma=1$ and
$\sigma_s=0.99$, and the channel has $\sigma=0.01$ and $\sigma_s=0.0099$. It has
reflecting boundaries on the top, left, and right sides, and an incident
boundary condition on the bottom. The geometry and cross sections are similar to Larsen
and Trahan's VHTR problem \cite{Lar2009c}.

We compare the AD method using three different boundary conditions for $f$ on
the bottom surface: a reflecting boundary, a white boundary, and a vacuum
boundary. The vacuum boundary is not consistent with our theory but
is shown to gauge how much $\phi$ is affected by the choice of $\zeta$.

Figure~\ref{fig:bcChannelIsotropic} shows a line-out of the scalar flux
$\phi(2.5,y)$, along the center
of the channel. Standard diffusion fails because $\sigma=0.01$ leads to a very
large diffusion coefficient, resulting in a nearly constant solution inside the
channel. Anisotropic diffusion performs exceedingly well, and curiously the
white boundary gives a better result than the reflecting boundary.

  \label{fig:bcChannelGrazing}
\end{figure}

A visualization of the angular flux for each method (replacing Monte Carlo with
an \SN\ solution), Fig.~\ref{fig:bcChannelIsotropicAngular}, helps explain the
accuracy
of the AD method and the difference between the reflecting and white boundary
treatments. Even though AD cannot exactly model the peak of freely streaming
photons in the channel (which the \SN\ angular flux shows at $\theta=3\pi/2$),
it accurately approximates the angular flux shape driven by scattering from the
diffusive region (the lobes on the left and right).
The linear-in-angle diffusion approximation cannot represent any of these
features.

  \caption{Angular flux $\psi(2.5, 1., \theta)$, in the centerline of the
  channel one unit from the boundary.}
  \label{fig:bcChannelIsotropicAngular}
\end{figure}

The shape around $\theta=\pi/2$ gives insight into why the white boundary
performs better in this problem: a reflecting boundary produces a peak in $f$
along the channel, but a white boundary gives a more isotropic shape near that
range, better matching the incident isotropic boundary condition. This suggests
that the qualitatively best way to satisfy Eq.~\eqref{eq:zetaCondition} may be
to have $\zeta$ take the shape of the true boundary condition.

Here we consider a difficult problem that has repeating variations in both $x$
and $y$ directions. It uses $c=0.99$,
