This is the introduction.

Thermal radiative transfer \cite{Urb2006,McC2008a}, nonlinear radiative transfer
\cite{Den2009}, radiative transfer and material temperature
\cite{Gen2001,Mor2000}, thermal radiation transport \cite{McC2007,Dav2010},

Morel's tensor diffusion work \cite{Mor2007} says to use regular diffusion near
problem boundaries, etc. It also talks about how only one transport sweep is
needed.

Material energy density \cite{Su2001}
