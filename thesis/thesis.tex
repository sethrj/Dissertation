% ABSTRACT
\begin{finalabstract}
Motivated by the Center for Radiative Shock Hydrodynamics (CRASH) uncertainty
quantification project, which needs to simulate hundreds of instances of a
complex multiphysics problem, we desire a method more accurate than diffusion
but less costly than time-dependent transport. We believe we have found this
middle ground: an anisotropic diffusion (AD) method that uses
transport-calculated AD coefficients to solve the thermal radiative transfer
equations.

Using the integral transport equation for the angular intensity, we derive an
expression for the radiation flux that depends on a non-local function of the
opacity. This nonlocal function is the solution of a purely absorbing transport
equation with albedo boundary conditions, and the function's second angular
moment is the anisotropic diffusion tensor. A system of low-order equations
solves for the scalar intensity using the AD coefficients. To demonstrate the
AD method's speed and efficacy, we simulate a mock-up of the CRASH project's
problem of interest, radiation flow down a channel in ``flatland'' geometry.

\begin{comment}
  This dissertation would not have been possible without a lifetime of others
  building me up. The foremost of these mentors are my parents, who helped my
  interest in science to blossom at an early age \cite{Lew1989}.
  Much of my foundation in science is due to the extracurricular efforts of my
  science and math teachers over the years. Kristen Jones'
  leadership in high school stands out particularly.
  I am also grateful for Bruce Freeman's invaluable opinions, advice, and
  support during my undergraduate internships.
  Kevin Clarno, during my internship at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, was an
  integral force in shaping my interest in reactor analysis and transport methods
  development.
  Todd Urbatsch and his work at Los Alamos National Laboratory provided me with
  the basis for many of the tools that helped with my research.

  My most recent mentor, Dr. Ed Larsen, has my greatest appreciation and thanks.
  His methodical derivations and practically limitless patience for an upstart
  like me were both essential in the development of my research project.

  In addition to these more formal mentors are my friends over the years who
  have taken something of a mentoring role. Greg Davidson, Jesse Cheatham, and
  Troy Becker all helped my transition to graduate school.
  The mentoring and friendship of Shaun and Adrianne Clarke have helped me to
  grow into an adult over these years in Michigan.
  %My officemates helped maintain my sanity on a day-to-day basis.

  I also thank the National Science Foundation for their support via their
  Graduate Research Fellowship Program, the Department of Energy for its
  Nuclear Energy University Programs fellowship, and the NERS department for its
  support and management of the day-to-day necessities.

  Finally, I offer all glory and praise to Jesus Christ, the Creator and my
  Redeemer. Apart from Him, nothing could be possible.
