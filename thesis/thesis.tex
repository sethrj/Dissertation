% ABSTRACT
\begin{finalabstract}
Motivated by the Center for Radiative Shock Hydrodynamics (CRASH) uncertainty
quantification project, which needs to simulate hundreds of instances of a
complex multiphysics problem, we desire a method more accurate than diffusion
but less costly than time-dependent transport. We believe we have found this
middle ground: an anisotropic diffusion (AD) method that uses
transport-calculated AD coefficients to solve the thermal radiative transfer
equations.

Using the integral transport equation for the angular intensity, we derive an
expression for the radiation flux that depends on a non-local function of the
opacity. This nonlocal function is the solution of a purely absorbing transport
equation with albedo boundary conditions, and the function's second angular
moment is the anisotropic diffusion tensor. A system of low-order equations
solves for the scalar intensity using the AD coefficients. To demonstrate the
AD method's speed and efficacy, we simulate a mock-up of the CRASH project's
problem of interest, radiation flow down a channel in ``flatland'' geometry.
