\begin{acknowledgments}
  This dissertation would not have been possible without a lifetime of
  edification by others. The foremost of these mentors are my
  parents, who helped my
  interest in science to blossom at an early age \cite{Lew1989}.
  Other strong influences over the years include Kristen Jones, whose
  leadership in high school Science Bowl stands out particularly;
  Bruce Freeman, who gave invaluable opinions, advice, and support during my
  undergraduate internships; Kevin Clarno, an
  integral force in shaping my interest in reactor analysis and transport
  methods; and the inimitable Todd Urbatsch, whose work and mentoring at LANL
  gave me a solid foundation for my TRT research projects and codes.

  My most recent mentor, Dr.~Ed Larsen, has my greatest appreciation and thanks.
  His methodical derivations---as well as his practically limitless patience for
  an upstart like myself---were essential in my graduate education and
  research experiences. The members of my committee also have my grateful
  appreciation for their help in this work.

  In addition to these more formal mentors are my friends over the years who
  have taken something of a mentoring role. Greg Davidson, Jesse Cheatham, and
  Troy Becker transitioned me into graduate school and have remained fast
  friends since.
  The particular friendship of Shaun and Adrianne Clarke have
  helped me to grow during these years in Michigan. My brother Aaron and sister
  Naomi have remained a source of motivation and endurance.
  Among the many other friends and family members who have encouraged me in my
  endeavors are Y.~Trump, M.~Graham, S.~Joshi, B.~Collins, K.~Wichman, and
  D.~Jabaay; but
  space does not permit me to enumerate all whom I value and appreciate.

  I also thank the National Science Foundation for its financial support via
  the Graduate Research Fellowship Program, the Department of Energy for its
  Nuclear Energy University Programs fellowship, and the NERS department for its
  support and its management of the day-to-day necessities.

  Finally, I offer all glory and praise to Jesus Christ, the Creator and my
  Redeemer. Apart from Him, nothing could be possible---especially not this
  dissertation.
