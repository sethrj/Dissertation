% ABSTRACT
\begin{finalabstract}
  This paper presents a [synonym for new] method for [sciency verb] the [noun
  few people have every heard of]. Using [something you didn't invent],
  the [property] was measured to be [number]$\pm$[number] [units].
  Results show [sexy adjective] agreement with theoretical predictions and
  significant improvement over previous efforts by [Loser], et al. The work
  presented here has profound implications for future studies of [buzzword] and
  may one day help solve to problem of [supreme sociological concern].
