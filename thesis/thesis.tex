%\begin{comment}
  This dissertation would not have been possible without a lifetime of
  edification by others. The foremost of these mentors are my
  parents, who helped my
  interest in science to blossom at an early age \cite{Lew1989}.
  Much of my foundation in science is due to the extracurricular efforts of my
  science and math teachers over the years. Kristen Jones'
  leadership in high school stands out particularly.
  I am also grateful for Bruce Freeman's invaluable opinions, advice, and
  support during my undergraduate internships.
  Kevin Clarno, during my first stint at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, was an
  integral force in shaping my interest in reactor analysis and transport
  methods. The inimitable Todd Urbatsch and his work at Los Alamos National
  Laboratory provided me with
  the basis for many of the tools that helped with my research.

  My most recent mentor, Dr. Ed Larsen, has my greatest appreciation and thanks.
  His methodical derivations---as well as his practically limitless patience for
  an upstart like myself---were essential in the development of my research
  project.

  In addition to these more formal mentors are my friends over the years who
  have taken something of a mentoring role. Greg Davidson, Jesse Cheatham, and
  Troy Becker all helped my transition to graduate school; innumerable
  others (especially in room 1928 and my ``small group'') have played
  encouraging roles in my life.
  The mentoring and friendship of Shaun and Adrianne Clarke in particular have
  helped me to grow into an adult over these years in Michigan.
  %My officemates helped maintain my sanity on a day-to-day basis.

  I also thank the National Science Foundation for their support via their
  Graduate Research Fellowship Program, the Department of Energy for its
  Nuclear Energy University Programs fellowship, and the NERS department for its
  support and management of the day-to-day necessities.

  Finally, I offer all glory and praise to Jesus Christ, the Creator and my
  Redeemer. Apart from Him, nothing could be possible---especially not this
  dissertation.
