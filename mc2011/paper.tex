\begin{abstract}
This paper describes an anisotropic diffusion (AD) method that uses
transport-calculated AD coefficients to efficiently and accurately solve the
thermal radiative transfer (TRT) equations. By assuming weak gradients and angular moments in the radiation
intensity, we derive an expression for the radiation energy density that
depends on a non-local function of the opacity that yields an approximate
expression for the intensity that does not assume linearity in angle. The AD
coefficients can be solved with a single steady-state transport sweep once per
time step.
To demonstrate the AD method's efficacy, we model radiation flow down a tube
in ``flatland'' geometry.

\section{Introduction}
Thermal radiative transfer (TRT) is the nonlinear process describing the
dominant form of energy transfer in a very hot material, such as the interior
of a star or the
target of a laser-driven shock experiment. The equations describing TRT are
time-dependent, contain strong nonlinearities, and reside in a large phase
space $(\vec{x}, \vec{\Omega}, h\nu, t)$.
These difficulties make TRT the subject of significant work in methods
development, which typically balances fidelity against computational cost. 
Among high-fidelity methods are Fleck and Cummings' Implicit Monte Carlo
(IMC) method \cite{Fle1971} and the discrete ordinates (\SN) method
\cite{Mor1996}. Both of these methods require large amounts of computer time:
IMC requires large numbers of particles to accurately sample the large phase
space, and \SN\ has to iteratively ``sweep'' through all spatial cells and all
angles in the quadrature set. Furthermore, the requirement of storing the full
time-dependent angular intensity imposes a heavy burden on computer memory: IMC
must store millions of particles in a ``census'' at the end of the time step,
and \SN\ must store the calculated angular flux in all angles at all spatial
points. One prevalent low-fidelity method is flux-limited diffusion (FLD)
\cite{Ols2000}, which uses the diffusion approximation to eliminate the angular
variable and then applies a correction, the flux limiter, to counteract the
nonphysical infinite propagation speed of standard time-dependent diffusion.
Because the assumptions used to derive FLD do not hold in many practical
situations, and because high-fidelity methods may be unfeasibly expensive,
there is an impetus for the development of a method that hits a sweet spot
between accuracy and expense.

One example where true transport methods such as \SN\ can be unfeasible is in
uncertainty quantification, where large numbers of computer runs produce a
probability distribution function of some output parameters. The Center for
RAdiative Shock Hydrodynamics (CRASH) has the goal to assess the predictive
capability of computer simulations in high energy density systems
\cite{Crash2010}. A mock-up of this problem serves as the primary test case in
this work.

PREVIOUS WORK

This paper describes a new anisotropic diffusion (AD) method that uses
transport-calculated coefficients to efficiently and accurately solve the TRT
equations. By making assumptions about the strength of the gradients and
angular moment of the radiative intensity $I$, we systematically derive an
approximate expression for the scalar intensity $\phi$. The result is an
expression for the radiation flux, a function of the local radiation energy
gradient and a nonlocal anisotropic diffusion tensor. The AD tensor is the
second angular moment of a steady-state, purely absorbing transport problem
with a uniform source.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Theory}
We consider the gray TRT equations, which eliminate the energy unknown from the
full TRT description by approximating the energy dependence of the opacity
$\sigma$ and integrating over all energies. 
\begin{subequations} \label{eqs:fullGrayTRT}
The radiation field is described by a monoenergetic Boltzmann transport
equation:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:fullGrayTransport2}
  \frac{1}{c} \pder{I}{t}(\vec{x}, \vec{\Omega}, t)
  + \vec{\Omega} \vd \del I(\vec{x}, \vec{\Omega}, t) +
 \sigma(\vec{x}, T) I(\vec{x}, \vec{\Omega}, t)
  = \frac{\sigma(\vec{x}, T) a c [T(\vec{x},t)]^4}{4\pi} 
  + \frac{c Q(\vec{x},t)}{4\pi}
,.
\end{equation}
The material energy equation describes the time rate of change in the material
energy:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:fullGrayMaterial}
  \frac{1}{c_v}\pder{T}{t}(\vec{x}, t)
  = \sigma(\vec{x}, T) \int_{4\pi}  I \ud \Omega
    - \sigma(\vec{x}, T) ac [T(\vec{x},t)]^4 
\,.
\end{equation}
\end{subequations}

%The nonlinear Planck function $B$ and the generally nonlinear opacity $\sigma$ 

Integrating Eq.~\eqref{eq:fullGrayTransport2} over all angles gives an
expression for the conservation of energy in the radiation field:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:grayTransportZeroth}
 \frac1c \pder{\phi}{t}(\vec{x}, t)
  + \del \vd \vec{F}(\vec{x}, t) +
 \sigma(\vec{x}, T) \phi(\vec{x}, t)
  = c\sigma(\vec{x}, T) a [T(\vec{x},t)]^4 + cQ(\vec{x},t) \,.
\end{equation}
The zeroth angular moment of the radiation intensity is the scalar intensity,
\begin{equation*}
  \phi(\vec{x}, t) \equiv \int_{4\pi} I(\vec{x}, \vec{\Omega}, t) \ud \Omega\,,
\end{equation*}
which is related to the radiation energy density $E$ by $E = \phi/c$.
The first angular moment of $I$ is the radiation flux,
\begin{equation*}
  \vec{F}(\vec{x}, t) \equiv \int_{4\pi} \vec{\Omega} I(\vec{x}, \vec{\Omega},
  t) \ud \Omega\,.
\end{equation*}

If the right hand side of Eq.~\eqref{eq:fullGrayTransport2} is treated as a known
time-dependent quantity, the integrodifferential Boltzmann equation can be
transformed to an integral transport equation by considering sources and
attenuation along the characteristic ray that passes through the point
$\vec{x}$ along $\vec{\Omega}$ \cite{Pri2010}.
%Neglecting the initial and
%boundary conditions, the integral transport equation is
For simplicity, we consider only the spatiotemporal interior of a problem,
where the contribution of the boundary flux and initial condition are
exponentially small. With the initial and boundary terms neglected, the
integral transport equation is:
\begin{subequations} \label{eqs:integralTrtAngularFlux}
  \begin{equation} \label{eq:integralTrtAngularFluxFull}
    I(\vec{x}, \vec{\Omega}, t)
    =\int_{0}^{\infty}
    \eexp^{ -\tau(\vec{x}, \vec{x} - s \vec{\Omega}, \vec{\Omega}, t)}
    \hat Q(\vec{x} - s \vec{\Omega}, \vec{\Omega}, t-s/c) \ud s\,.
  \end{equation}
  The ``known'' source $\hat Q$ is the right hand side in Eq.~\eqref{eq:fullGrayTransport2},
  \begin{equation} \label{eq:integralTrtSource}
    \hat Q(\vec{x}, \vec{\Omega}, t) =  \frac{\sigma(\vec{x}, t) a c
    [T(\vec{x},t)]^4}{4\pi} + \frac{c Q(\vec{x},t)}{4\pi}\,.
  \end{equation}
  It is evaluated along the characteristic ray at a distance $s$, at the time
  $t-s/c$ at which a particle originating at that point reaches $(\vec{x},t)$.
  The optical thickness of the medium between points $\vec{x}$ and
  $\vec{x}'$ along direction $\vec{\Omega}$ is 
  \begin{equation} \label{eq:integralTrtTauDefinition}
    \tau(\vec{x}, \vec{x}', \vec{\Omega}, t) = \int_{0}^{\norm{\vec{x} -
    \vec{x}'}} \sigma(\vec{x}-s'\vec{\Omega}, t-s'/c) \ud s' \,.
  \end{equation}
\end{subequations}

Far from the problem's boundaries, $\norm{\vec{x} - \vec{x}_b} \sim \infty$,
and the optical thickness $\tau$ is very large, so only an exponentially small
approximation is made by discarding the $I^b$ term and writing the line
integral's upper limit as $\infty$. If $t\gg 0$, temporally distant from the
initial condition, then the term with $I^i$ is also small because of the large
number of mean free paths between $\vec{x}$ and $\vec{x} - c t$. It too may
therefore be neglected in the spatiotemporal interior.

Discarding those boundary terms and substituting $\hat Q$, Eq.~\eqref{eq:integralTrtAngularFluxFull} is, with only a small
approximation in the interior,
\begin{equation*}
    I(\vec{x}, \vec{\Omega}, t)
    = \frac{1}{4\pi}\int_{0}^{\infty}
    \eexp^{ -\tau(\vec{x}, \vec{x} - s \vec{\Omega}, \vec{\Omega}, t)}
    \left[ \sigma a c T^4 + c Q \right]_{(\vec{x} - s
    \vec{\Omega}, t-s/c)} \ud s\,.
\end{equation*}
The quantity in brackets is just the right-hand side of the conservation
equation~\eqref{eq:grayTransportZeroth}. Replacing it with the left-hand
side,
\begin{equation}\label{eq:integralTrtLhs}
    I(\vec{x}, \vec{\Omega}, t)
    = \frac{1}{4\pi}\int_{0}^{\infty}
    \eexp^{ -\tau(\vec{x}, \vec{x} - s \vec{\Omega}, \vec{\Omega}, t)}
    \left[ \sigma \phi + \frac{1}{c} \pder{\phi}{t} +\del \vd \vec{F}
    \right]_{(\vec{x} - s \vec{\Omega}, t-s/c)} \ud s\,.
\end{equation}
We will individually evaluate each constituent term of this integral.

To expand and simplify Eq.~\eqref{eq:integralTrtLhs}, it is necessary to make
an ansatz about
the strength of the derivatives and moments of some terms in the transport
equation:
\begin{align*}
  I &= O(\epsiloncolor{1}), &
  \sigma &= O(\epsiloncolor{1}), &
  \del I &= O(\epsiloncolor{\epsilon}), &
  \frac1c\pder{I}{t} &= O(\epsiloncolor{\epsilon}), &
  \frac1c\pder{\sigma}{t} &= O(\epsiloncolor{\epsilon}), &
  \int_{4\pi} \vec{\Omega} I\ud \Omega &= O(\epsiloncolor{\epsilon}).
\end{align*}
These assumptions are different (and less rigorous) than the set traditionally
used to derive the radiation diffusion equations \cite{Lar1983a}. They will
lead to an approximate expression for the angular intensity that is
\emph{not} linear in angle.

We consider the first term of Eq.~\eqref{eq:integralTrtLhs}: 
\begin{align*}
\lefteqn{\frac{1}{4\pi}\int_{0}^{\infty} \eexp^{ -\int_{0}^{s}
  \sigma(\vec{x}-s'\vec{\Omega}, t-s'/c) \ud s'} \sigma(\vec{x} - s \vec{\Omega}, t-s/c)
\phi(\vec{x} - s \vec{\Omega}, t-s/c) \ud s \,.}\qquad&
\\ 
\intertext{By the fundamental theorem of calculus, this is equal without
approximation to}
&=\frac{1}{4\pi}\int_{0}^{\infty} \left( - \oder{}{s} \eexp^{ -\int_{0}^{s}
  \sigma(\vec{x}-s'\vec{\Omega}, t-s'/c) \ud s'}\right)
\phi(\vec{x} - s \vec{\Omega}, t-s/c) \ud s
\\
\intertext{Integrating by parts, assuming that $\phi$ is bounded as
$s\to\infty$, the first term is}
    \begin{split}
  &=-\frac{1}{4\pi} \bigg[ 
\eexp^{- \int_{0}^{s} \sigma(\vec{x}-s'\vec{\Omega}, t-s'/c) \ud s'} 
\phi(\vec{x} - s \vec{\Omega}, t-s/c) \bigg|_{0}^{\infty}
\\
&\qquad\qquad- \int_{0}^{\infty} \eexp^{- \int_{0}^{s} \sigma(\vec{x}-s'\vec{\Omega}, t-s'/c) \ud s'}
\oder{}{s} \phi(\vec{x} - s \vec{\Omega}, t-s/c)
\ud s
  \bigg]
    \end{split}
  \\
  &=-\frac{1}{4\pi} \bigg[ 
0 -  
\eexp^0 \phi(\vec{x}, t)
- \int_{0}^{\infty} \eexp^{-\tau(\vec{x}, \vec{x} - s \vec{\Omega}, \vec{\Omega}, t)}
\oder{}{s} \phi(\vec{x} - s \vec{\Omega}, t-s/c)
\ud s
  \bigg]
  \\
 &=\frac{1}{4\pi}\phi(\vec{x}, t)
+ \frac{1}{4\pi}\ \int_{0}^{\infty} \eexp^{-\tau(\vec{x}, \vec{x} - s \vec{\Omega}, \vec{\Omega}, t)}
\oder{}{s} \phi(\vec{x} - s \vec{\Omega}, t-s/c)
\ud s\,,
 \\
 \intertext{or, rewriting the streaming derivative,}
 &=\frac{1}{4\pi}\phi(\vec{x}, t)
+ \frac{1}{4\pi}\ \int_{0}^{\infty} \eexp^{-\tau(\vec{x}, \vec{x} - s
\vec{\Omega}, \vec{\Omega}, t)}
\left[ -\vec{\Omega} \vd \del - \frac1c \pder{}{t} \right] \phi(\vec{x} - s \vec{\Omega}, t-s/c)
\ud s\,.
\end{align*}

So far, no approximations have been made, but the integral involves unknowns at
all spatial points along $s$ at prior points in time. However, using the
assumptions about the strength of the derivatives, we can approximate the
nonlocal unknowns with Taylor series. First, we take a Taylor series in space
and time to find $\phi(\vec{x} - s \vec{\Omega}, t-s/c)$ about $ \phi(\vec{x},
t)$
\begin{align*}
  \phi(\vec{x} - s \vec{\Omega}, t-s/c)
  &\sim
  \phi(\vec{x}, t) - s \vec{\Omega} \vd \del \phi(\vec{x}, t)
  - s\frac{1}{c} \pder{\phi}{t}(\vec{x}, t) + \cdots
  \\
  &= \phi(\vec{x}, t) - s \left[ \vec{\Omega} \vd \del
  + \frac{1}{c} \pder{}{t} \right] \phi(\vec{x}, t) + \cdots
  \\
  &= O(\epsiloncolor{1}) +
  O(\epsiloncolor{\epsilon}) + \cdots\,.
\end{align*}
Second, we take a Taylor series only in time for the opacity $\sigma$ embedded
in the optical thickness $\tau$:
\begin{align*}
  \sigma(\vec{x} - s \vec{\Omega}, t-s/c)
  &\sim
  \sigma(\vec{x} - s \vec{\Omega}, t)
  - s\frac{1}{c} \pder{\sigma}{t}(\vec{x} - s \vec{\Omega}, t) + \cdots
  \\
  &= O(\epsiloncolor{1}) + O(\epsiloncolor{\epsilon}) + \cdots\,.
\end{align*}
The expansion of $\phi$ allows it to be moved outside the integral, and the
expansion of $\sigma$ obviates the storage of all prior $\sigma$:
\begin{multline*}
  \int_{0}^{\infty} \eexp^{- \int_{0}^{s} \sigma(\vec{x}-s'\vec{\Omega}, t-s'/c) \ud s'}
\left[ -\vec{\Omega} \vd \del - \frac1c \pder{}{t} \right] \phi(\vec{x} - s \vec{\Omega}, t-s/c)
\ud s
\\
\sim \int_{0}^{\infty} \eexp^{- \int_{0}^{s} \sigma(\vec{x}-s'\vec{\Omega}, t)
\ud s'} \ud s
\left[ -\vec{\Omega} \vd \del - \frac1c \pder{}{t} \right] \phi(\vec{x}, t)
+ O(\epsilon^2)
\end{multline*}
Therefore, the $\sigma\phi$ component of Eq.~\eqref{eq:integralTrtLhs} is
approximated as
\begin{multline}\label{eq:term1Approx}
  \frac{1}{4\pi}\int_{0}^{\infty} \eexp^{ -\tau(\vec{x}, \vec{x} - s
  \vec{\Omega}, \vec{\Omega}, t)} \sigma(\vec{x} - s \vec{\Omega}, t-s/c)
  \phi(\vec{x} - s \vec{\Omega}, t-s/c) \ud s
  \\
  \sim 
  \frac{1}{4\pi}\underbrace{\phi(\vec{x}, t)}_{O(1)}
  + \frac{1}{4\pi}\int_{0}^{\infty} \eexp^{- \int_{0}^{s} \sigma(\vec{x}-s'\vec{\Omega}, t)
\ud s'} \ud s
\underbrace{\left[ -\vec{\Omega} \vd \del - \frac1c \pder{}{t} \right]}_{O(\epsilon)} \phi(\vec{x}, t)\,.
\end{multline}

The second component of Eq.~\eqref{eq:integralTrtLhs}, the time derivative
term, is treated very much like the first: $\phi$ is expanded about
$(\vec{x},t)$, and $\sigma$ is expanded about $(\vec{x}-s\vec{\Omega},t)$. Thus,
\begin{multline}\label{eq:term2Approx}
  \frac{1}{4\pi}\int_{0}^{\infty} \eexp^{ -\tau(\vec{x}, \vec{x} - s
  \vec{\Omega}, \vec{\Omega}, t)}
  \frac{1}{c} \pder{}{t}\phi(\vec{x} - s \vec{\Omega}, t-s/c) \ud s
 \\
 \sim 
  \frac{1}{4\pi}\int_{0}^{\infty} \eexp^{- \int_{0}^{s} \sigma(\vec{x}-s'\vec{\Omega}, t)
  \ud s'} \ud s
  \underbrace{\frac{1}{c} \pder{}{t}}_{O(\epsilon)}\phi(\vec{x}, t)\,.
\end{multline}
TIME DERIVATIVES CANCEL

The third $\del \vd \vec{F}$ component of Eq.~\eqref{eq:integralTrtLhs}, which
is the composition of two $O(\epsilon)$ operations, is $O(\epsilon^2)$ and
discarded. This gives us an approximate expression for the angular intensity:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:anisotropicIntensity}
  I(\vec{x}, \vec{\Omega}, t) \approx
  \frac{1}{4\pi}\phi(\vec{x}, t) - \left[ \int_{0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{4\pi}
  \eexp^{- \int_{0}^{s} \sigma(\vec{x}-s'\vec{\Omega}, t)
  \ud s'} \ud s\right]
\vec{\Omega} \vd \del \phi(\vec{x}, t)
\end{equation}
Taking the first angular moment of the approximate intensity gives an
approximate expression for the radiation flux $\vec{F}$:
\begin{align*}
  \vec{F}(\vec{x}, t) &= \int_{4\pi} \vec{\Omega} I(\vec{x}, \vec{\Omega}, t) \ud \Omega
  \\
  &=
  \frac{1}{4\pi}\phi(\vec{x}, t) \int_{4\pi} \vec{\Omega} \ud \Omega
  \\
  &\qquad-  \int_{4\pi} \vec{\Omega} \left[ \int_{0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{4\pi}
  \eexp^{- \int_{0}^{s} \sigma(\vec{x}-s'\vec{\Omega}, t)
  \ud s'} \ud s\right]
\vec{\Omega}  \ud \Omega \vd \del \phi(\vec{x}, t)
\\
&= - \left[ \int_{4\pi} (\vec{\Omega} \otimes \vec{\Omega})  f(\vec{x},\vec{\Omega},t)
 \ud \Omega \right] \vd \del \phi(\vec{x}, t)
\\
&= - \Dtens(\vec{x},t) \vd \del \phi(\vec{x}, t)\,,
\end{align*}
where $f$ satisfies the ``steady-state'' transport equation
\begin{equation} \label{eq:dcoeffTransportEquation}
  \vec{\Omega}\vd \del f(\vec{x},\vec{\Omega},t) + \sigma(\vec{x},t) f(\vec{x},\vec{\Omega},t) =
  \frac{1}{4\pi}\,.
\end{equation}

\subsection{Revisiting the assumptions}
physical interpretation of $\sigma$ term, neglecting nonlocality of $\sigma$

radiation flux is $O(\epsilon)$

$I$ is $O(1)$

\subsection{Discussion}
  The anisotropic diffusion tensor $\Dtens(\vec{x},t)$: 
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Results from consistent approximations to the transport equation
      using physical coefficients
    \item Reduces to $\mat{I}/3\sigma$ for infinite homogeneous
      medium, which gives standard diffusion solution
    \item Has a smaller magnitude across a channel than along it
    \item Does not ``blow up'' in void regions
    \item Is continuous in $\vec{x}$, so the anisotropic solution $\phi$
      has continuous first derivatives
  \end{itemize}

  The transport problem used to calculate $\Dtens$,
  Eq.~\eqref{eq:dcoeffTransportEquation},
  \begin{equation*}
    \vec{\Omega}\vd \del f + \sigma f = \frac{1}{4\pi} \,,
  \end{equation*}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Takes only one transport sweep to solve, since it is the description
      of a purely absorbing medium
    \item Only needs to be calculated once if $\sigma$ is constant in time
    \item Requires no storage of the angular flux, just accumulation of second
      moment, $D_{ij} = \int_{4\pi} \Omega_i \Omega_j f \ud \Omega$
    \item Has the solution $f=1/4\pi\sigma$ if $\sigma$ is a constant.
      Then, $\int_{4\pi} \vec{\Omega} f \vec{\Omega} \ud \Omega =
      \mat{I}/3\sigma$.
  \end{itemize}

\section{Numerical Results}

The benchmark solution is Fleck and Cummings' IMC \cite{Fle1971}, implemented
with variance reduction methods and using $10^6$ particles per time step. IMC
correctly prevents photons from exceeding the speed of light, but it is subject
to statistical noise and the semi-implicit linearization error.

The most important competitor for flux-limited diffusion, implemented with
the Larsen limiter \cite{Ols2000}. It treats the diffusion coefficient and
physics semi-implicitly, and its approximation for the radiation flux is
\begin{equation*}
  \vec{F}_\text{FLD}^{n+1} = - D^{n} \del \phi^{n+1}  = -\left[ (3\sigma^{n})^2
  + \left( \frac{\norm{\del \phi^{n}}}{\phi^{n}}  \right)^2 \right]^{-1/2}
  \del \phi^{n+1}
\end{equation*}

Also compared is standard diffusion theory, which uses Fick's law:
\begin{equation*}
  \vec{F}_\text{D}^{n+1} = - D^{n} \del \phi^{n+1} 
  = -\frac{1}{3\sigma^{n}} \del \phi^{n+1}
\end{equation*}
The time-dependent diffusion equation incorrectly allows radiation energy to
propagate faster than $c$.

\subsection{Problem description}
The problem models radiation flowing down a pipe in flatland geometry, where
photons are constrained to the plane. (This contrasts 2D geometry, where a gap
extends infinitely into and out of the page.) It uses scaled units with $c=a=1$. Fig.~\ref{fig:crashpipeMaterial}
shows the material layout for the problem.
\begin{figure}[htb]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.99\textwidth]{../figures/crashpipe2/materials}
  \caption{Material properties for the pipe problem. The blue square is the
  source, the green channel is a low-opacity region, and the red regions are
  diffusive.}
  \label{fig:crashpipeMaterial}
\end{figure}
The source has a volumetric source
$Q=1$ for $0 \le t \le 1$ and turns off at $t=1$.
That region has $c_v=0.5$ and
$\sigma=0.5$. The diffusive region has a small heat capacity $c_v=0.1$, and an
inverse cubic opacity, $\sigma=T^{-3}$. The streaming channel region has
$c_v=0.1$ and $\sigma=0.01 T^{-3}$. The material temperature and radiation
temperature ($a c T_\text{rad}^4 = \phi$) are $T=T_\text{rad}=0.1$.
 The left boundary is reflecting, and the others are vacuum.
